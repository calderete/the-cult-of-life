### Time

In the far distant future days are measured in calendar cycles or "Caldex"(day equivalent) which is roughly 28 hours. The equivalent of a year would be the "Annual Cycle" or "Adex" which lasts 300 calendar cycles, each Adex is broken up into 10 Calendar Rotations or "Kaydex" (month equivalent) each kaydex consisting of 30 caldex.

The 300 amount is derived from the "Universal Galactic Rotation Cycle" or "Galadum" which is approximately 313 calendar cycles(caldex) (about 365 days/ 1 year). Many galaxies have been observed rotating at the same speed known as a Deonox; approximately 1 galactic rotation per 1 billion Adex(years). A Metadex is 1,000,000 Adex. A Heptadex is 10,000 Adex.

100 seconds make an Interum(interval) 100,000 seconds make up one caldex. A caldex is also split into 10 interdex. Each interdex is made up of 10 setadex, each setadex is made of 10 interum. Half an interdex is about 1 and half hours.

**Intex-Seta-Inem**

Imex = 1 second<br>
Interum = 100 seconds<br>
Setadex = 1,000 (16 minutes)<br>
Interdex = 10,000(slightly less than 3 hours)<br>
Caldex = 100,000(slightly less than 28 hours)<br>

**Ada-Kayd-Caldex**

Adex = 10 Kaydex/300 Caldex<br>
Soradex = 100 Adex (Soral Cycle)<br>
Tekadex 1,000 Adex (Teka Cycle)<br>
Heptadex = 10,000 Adex (Heptagex Cycle)<br>
Metadex = 1,000,000 Adex (Metalogos Cycle)<br>
Deonox = 1,000,000,000 Adex (Deonoxium Cycle)<br>

### Distance

Stardex is the distance light travels in an Adex<br>
setch = inch equivalent<br>
setta = 20 setch<br>
tekudex = 100,000 setch (~a mile and a half) or 5000 setta<br>

Nama-setch = 10th of a setch<br>
seggeta = 100th of a setch<br>

### Addresses and locations

The Agion Guardianship has a presence in hundreds of galaxies, all named. Galaxies are then divided by features (arms, rings...) into galactic divisions sometimes called Destaspan, these are also named. Each destapan is divided into sectors (Dovospan) and can be made up of thousands of Dovospan. A Dovospan can contain between a few dozen to hundreds of star/planetary systems.
