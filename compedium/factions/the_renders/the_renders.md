A race of invisible creatures that can only be seen when they chose to interact with realspace. Once they have discovered a planet with a suitable amount of biomass and metal in its crust they invade it...few can resist their soldiers, which are invisible and covered in diamond hard armor, several of their limbs end with a single diamond sharp claw that extends three and half setta (~6 feet).

Once all opposition had been neutralized the world is transformed into one of their hive worlds. The Veskas will cultivate crops using the available biomass as fertilizer, the Veskas themselves have inscrutable diets that include some living things and mostly minerals...they have a taste for zinc and aluminum especially. The crops they grow are also heavy in mineral and metal content.

From the hive hatcheries a brand new empress mother will be born to birth another army and send it to the next world for conquest. The workers that the empress births will dig deep into the crust of the world and create tunnels for their constructs, they will turn the entire planet into an organism made to teleport their army to the next planet.

Another reason for their success rate is the surprise with which they strike. With no warning billions of invisible and near indestructible warriors are teleported all over a world...any organized opposition usually does not last longer than few caldex (~ days).
