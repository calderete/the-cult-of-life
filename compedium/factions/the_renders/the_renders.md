A race of invisible creatures that can only be seen when they chose to interact with their environment. Once they have discovered a planet with a suitable amount of biomass they invade it...few can resist their soldiers, which are invisible and covered in diamond hard armor, several of their limbs end with a single diamond sharp claw that extends three and half setta (~6 feet).

Once all opposition had been neutralized the rest of native biomass is consumed and the world is transformed into one of their hive worlds, from its hatcheries a brand new empress mother will be born to birth another army and send it to the next world for conquest. They will dig deep into the crust of the world and create tunnels for their constructs, the entire planet is turned into an organism made to teleport their army to the next planet.

Another reason for their success rate is the surprise with which they strike. With no warning billions of invisible and near indestructible warriors are teleported all over a world...any organized opposition usually does not last longer than few caldex (~ days).
