The cult of life is the edict that if there is no life, and no creation, and no thriving life, and no ascension in the universe. Above all else live should be treated as sacred and taken only when needed and never in imbalance or injustice.

Immortality, nirvana, heaven is all attainable to any beings, be that in most cases it will be distant descendants of a species/g-matrix that has just begun the long path to ascension. An ascendant being can be/do whatever they please for as long as they please. In the highest of forms a consciousness of and ascendant being will travel from galaxy to galaxy, observing anything from all spectra of light, and able to manipulate matter to the level of causing chemical reactions.


and if they get tired, they may hibernate for an age.

It is required that a species ascend through the cosmic stratum which is a series of steps of which the end goal is to become an ascendant species/gene-matrix


### Main plot

the MC is a soldier, we meet her on a construction rig serving a one thousand adex sentence for killing an innocent. It is the end of her sentence, at this point she has lost track of time and has no idea when she will be released. When she had been sentenced she was given over the Eradeus maxur, who assigned her to Maxur regu'vetum. Under the command of the Maxur' she was first sent to receive a bio re-sync and rejuvenation once she reported for service of her debt to society. She was also to receive the same rejuvenation every 50 adex ensuring that she serve, and be able to serve every day of her sentence. A condition of her sentence is that she was never given a way to track time, and the prisoners are never told what

She is sent to work on the hyper-metal mining rig above the cold gas giant _Onjer'deresta_, laying shield panels. They work on the shoulders of those that built the scaffolding which has its foundations on the hot metal core of the planet. The foundations are kept in place with exotic struts maintained a people called the _Dreem Heur'rie_. The dreem heur'rie are adapted to live under immense pressure, their existence is a slow moving one as they feast on the exotic compounds only found deep within certain gas giants. They experience time much slower, and move very slow, the machines they build however, are extremely fast. In their world, which they call the funnel they refine metals and maintain auto-forges which fabricate exotic plates from the metal mined from _Onjer'deresta_ and sends them up the orbital rings forges to be worked, refined, and sent to their destinations.

Her job is laying shield paneling while suspended above _Onjer'deresta_ building the hemnatic shield which will provide a normalized environment for the diverse peoples that will come to work the orbital forge.




### Cult of life edicts

The cult of life only advises, not dictates

The edicts of the cult of life need not be adopted in full (to a species ability and holistic will)
