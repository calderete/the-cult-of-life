The cult of life is the edict that if there is no life, and no creation, and no thriving life, and no ascension in the universe. Above all else live should be treated as sacred and taken only when needed and never in imbalance or injustice.

Immortality, nirvana, heaven is all attainable to any beings, be that in most cases it will be distant descendants of a species/g-matrix that has just begun the long path to ascension. An ascendant being can be/do whatever they please for as long as they please. In the highest of forms a consciousness of and ascendant being will travel from galaxy to galaxy, observing anything from all spectra of light, and able to manipulate matter to the level of causing chemical reactions.


and if they get tired, they may hibernate for an age.

It is required that a species ascend through the cosmic stratum which is a series of steps of which the end goal is to become an ascendant species/gene-matrix
