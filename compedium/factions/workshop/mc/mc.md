Long range support, by Prix'vero Botha

Some I kill...some I save.

Sometimes, from the same matrix, or species.

I can resuscitate thousands of different beings.

Or I can strike them down at over 10,000 setta.

Prix'vero Botha, born Hakmat Ira'Iahma on the tropical world of Ver'mel. Ver'mel is primarily inhabited by the a bipedal species known as the Huso. Her family objected to her joining the legion.

The Huso have a history with the Hyperg'enot, their ancestors having once been an enslaved race. The Huso are known for their high durability, and excellent soldiering skills. They are exceptionally courageous and prone to neurosis


### Prix'vero Botha
Older brother Geptur'verka Botha: "so what did the lower legion make you little bro?"
Prix'vero Bothe: "frontline support...and not that it matters to me, but I'm also your sister now..."
Bro: "haha...just messing with ya!...sis haha.... hey do you think they made you a medic because you made them turn you into a girl?"
Prix: "...umm...well I'm not just a medic...mom you said he wouldn't say stuff like that"
Mother Zeltura'vrix: "Geptur, be nice, remember our talk at breakfast!"
Bro: "hey I'm just saying...you know how most of the nurses are girls, I figured the legion is the same way haha"
Father Resamma'alturouh: "hm"
Prix: (in her head) *the protectorate told me to stay out of trouble on leave, I'd be in a lot of trouble if I got reported fighting...*

Onjer Deresta

Work camp Ishino north, Erack Freedom Forge complex

debtor ONJ-45-355-737-617-492 (Prix'vero Botha)

Onjer Deresta was a regal blue and white spotted jewel which the Ogion Plago had decreed to be mined and a ring of forges built around it to supply alloys to the protectorate, a project which would take many heptadex (heptadex ~= 10,000 years). And so the surface was colonized by the Dreem Heur'rie and giant scaffolding towers were lowered into the inhospitable clouds and onto its crushing surface were the Dreem maintained the tower anchors and foundations.

Work camp Ishino north was suspended high above the roiling clouds of the cold gas giant on one of the planetary pilings that had been lowered to the firma below. Ishino was one camp of thousands around the planet, a collection of hundreds of tekudex of modular walk ways, hab units, and storage clustered around its support tower and hanging from cables anchored above the camp on the support tower.

Debtor 492's steps on the metal grating of a walk way made a familiar muted metallic thump transmitted through her boots and into her helmet as she made her way back and forth. She held her burden close, a clear rad shield panel one lirhetta (~ 1 meter) square weighing exactly 140 ketch (~70 pounds). The panel was one of trillions to be layed at the Erack freedom forge complex, and one of millions that 492 had carried and placed in her endless time here. Above the blue and white clouds of Onjer'deresta, her existence had been unchanging, panels arrive and are staged, and then debtors go out on the construction gondolas loaded with hundreds of panels and under the direction of the crew bosses laid the clear shields to be suspended above the sky of Onjer until they ran out panels, then they would return to the camp and either stage new panels or go out again.


-------------------------------------------------

She never talked about her past much when she joined the legion, and they didn't ask much. Even while the facts were read out to the arbiter general and all present in the grey tribunal hall heard the investigators say "Prix'vero Botha killed Betrano'deix, and injured several others, including her step-brother Geptur'verka Botha ..."
