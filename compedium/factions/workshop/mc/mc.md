Long range support, by Prix'vero Botha

Some I kill...some I save.

Sometimes, from the same matrix, or species.

I can resuscitate thousands of different beings.

Or I can strike them down at over 10,000 setta.

Prix'vero Botha, born Hakmat Ira'Iahma on the tropical world of Ver'mel. Ver'mel is primarily inhabited by the a bipedal species known as the Huso. Her family objected to her joining the legion.

The Huso have a history with the Hyperg'enot, their ancestors having once been an enslaved race. The Huso are known for their high durability, and excellent soldiering skills. They are exceptionally courageous and prone to neurosis


### Prix'vero Botha
Older brother Geptur'verka Botha: "so what did the lower legion make you little bro?"
Prix'vero Bothe: "frontline support...and not that it matters to me, but I'm also your sister now..."
Bro: "haha...just messing with ya!...sis haha.... hey do you think they made you a medic because you made them turn you into a girl?"
Prix: "...umm...well I'm not just a medic...mom you said he wouldn't say stuff like that"
Mother Zeltura'vrix: "Geptur, be nice, remember our talk at breakfast!"
Bro: "hey I'm just saying...you know how most of the nurses are girls, I figured the legion is the same way haha"
Father Resamma'alturouh: "hm"
Prix: (in her head) *the protectorate told me to stay out of trouble on leave, I'd be in a lot of trouble if I got reported fighting...*

Onjer Deresta

Work camp Ishino north, Erack Freedom Forge complex

debtor ONJ-45-355-737-617-492 (Prix'vero Botha)

Onjer Deresta was a regal blue and white spotted jewel which the Ogion Plago had decreed to be mined and a ring of forges built around it to supply alloys to the native systems, a fate only given to lifeless planets, the project would take many heptadex (heptadex ~= 10,000 years). And so the core surface was colonized by the Dreem Heur'rie —a species adapted to the crushing depths of gas giants— and giant scaffolding towers were lowered into the inhospitable clouds and onto its crushing black depths where the Dreem maintained the tower anchors and foundations.

High above the roiling clouds from one of those scaffolding towers was suspended work camp Ishino north. It was one camp of thousands around the planet, each a collection of millions of tekudex (~1.5 miles) of modular walk ways, hab units, work yards, and storage.

Debtor 492's steps on the metal grating of a walk way made a familiar muted metallic thump transmitted through her boots and into her helmet as she made her way back and forth. She held her burden close, a clear rad shield panel one lirhetta (~ 1 meter) square weighing exactly 140 ketch (~70 pounds). The panel was one of trillions to be layed at the Erack freedom forge complex, and one of millions that 492 had carried and placed in her endless time here.

Above the blue and white clouds of Onjer'deresta, her existence had been unchanging, panels arrive and are staged, and then debtors go out on the construction gondolas and under the direction of the crew bosses lay the shield panles to be suspended above the sky of Onjer until they ran out panels, then they would return to the camp and either stage new panels or go out again. This cycle she was staging. Endless pacing of the grates, her legs and back straining in the 7 hetter (~1.75 G) gravity. Her shoulders and neck were familiar knotted masses, as she reached the end of the panel stack and set her burden into its place she also felt the deck plates begin to shake. She could not hear the shuttle landing, but could feel it through the scaffolding as it fired its thrusters and set down on the landing deck. Next she heard clicking in her helmet followed by a crew boss's voice "service debtors report to flight deck"

She never talked about her past much when she joined the legion, and they didn't ask much. Even while the facts were read out to the arbiter general and all present in the grey tribunal hall heard the investigators say "Prix'vero Botha killed Betrano'deix, and injured several others, including her step-brother Geptur'verka Botha ..." there was nothing to say in her defense, the surveillance drones had seen everything, she had murdered an innocent. The arbiter stood, his grey cloaks hiding his many arms, and through his faceplate spoke "are you familiar with the justice of the protectorate?" he asked, his voice was an electric trill through his universal translator "ah..a little...I've only been in the legion a year..." she started to reply until he interrupted "no matter, listen closely what I'm about to tell you is your right to know. The penalty for intentional murder is the same for all...you will spend the next one thousand adex in service to the Eradeus maxur were you will labor on great works" her blood ran cold...so she was to die in prison a slave she thought? What the arbiter said next, both answered and confused her, "every fifty adex, you will report to bio re-synchronization to ensure your continued health and life while carrying out your sentence, "
