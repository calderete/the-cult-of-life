Long range support, by Sre'vero Botha

Some I kill...some I save.

Sometimes, from the same matrix, or species.

I can resuscitate thousands of different beings.

Or I can strike them down at over 10,000 setta.

Sre'vero Botha, born Hakmat Ira'Iahma on the tropical world of Ver'mel. Ver'mel is primarily inhabited by the a bipedal species known as the Huso. Her family objected to her joining the legion.

The Huso have a history with the Hyperg'enot, their ancestors having once been an enslaved race. The Huso are known for their high durability, and excellent soldiering skills.
