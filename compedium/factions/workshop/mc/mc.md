Long range support, by Prix'vero Botha

Some I kill...some I save

I resuscitate thousands

Or I strike down at 10,000 sett

Their craniums or nerve stems bursting

And I know it is a lethal blow

----------------------------------------

Prix'vero Botha, born Hakmat Ira'Iahma on the tropical world of Ver'mel. Ver'mel is primarily inhabited by the a bipedal species known as the Huso. Her family objected to her joining the legion.

The Huso have a history with the Hyperg'enot, their ancestors having once been an enslaved race. The Huso are known for their high durability, and excellent soldiering skills. They are exceptionally courageous.


### Prix'vero Botha
Older brother Geptur'verka Botha: "so what did the lower legion make you little bro?"
Prix'vero Bothe: "frontline support...and not that it matters to me, but I'm also your sister now..."
Bro: "haha...just messing with ya!...sis haha.... hey do you think they made you a medic because you made them turn you into a girl?"
Prix: "...umm...well I'm not just a medic...mom you said he wouldn't say stuff like that"
Mother Zeltura'vrix: "Geptur, be nice, remember our talk at breakfast!"
Bro: "hey I'm just saying...you know how most of the nurses are girls, I figured the legion is the same way haha"
Father Resamma'alturouh: "hm"
Prix: (in her head) *the protectorate told me to stay out of trouble on leave, I'd be in a lot of trouble if I got reported fighting...*

Onjer Deresta

Work camp Ishino north, Erack Freedom Forge complex

debtor ONJ-45-355-737-617-492 (Prix'vero Botha)

Onjer Deresta was a regal blue and white spotted jewel which the Ogion Plago had decreed to be mined and a ring of forges built around it to supply alloys to the native systems, a fate only given to lifeless planets, the project would take many heptadex (heptadex ~= 10,000 years). And so the core surface was colonized by the Dreem Heur'rie —a species adapted to the crushing depths of gas giants— and giant scaffolding towers were lowered into the inhospitable clouds and onto its crushing black depths where the Dreem maintained the tower anchors and foundations.

High above the roiling clouds from one of those scaffolding towers was suspended work camp Ishino north. It was one camp of thousands around the planet, each a collection of millions of tekudex (~1.5 miles) of modular walk ways, hab units, work yards, and storage.

Debtor 492's steps on the metal grating of a walk way made a familiar muted metallic thump transmitted through her boots and into her helmet as she made her way back and forth. She held her burden close, a clear rad shield panel one lirhetta (~ 1 meter) square weighing exactly 140 ketch (~70 pounds). The panel was one of trillions to be layed at the Erack freedom forge complex, and one of millions that 492 had carried and placed in her endless time here.

Above the blue and white clouds of Onjer'deresta, her existence had been unchanging, panels arrive and are staged, and then debtors go out on the construction gondolas and under the direction of the crew bosses lay the shield panles to be suspended above the sky of Onjer until they ran out panels, then they would return to the camp and either stage new panels or go out again. This cycle she was staging. Endless pacing of the grates, her legs and arms straining in the 7 hetter (~1.75 G) gravity. Her shoulders and back were familiar knotted masses, as she reached the end of the panel stack and set her burden into its place she also felt the deck plates begin to shake. She could not hear the shuttle landing directly, but could feel it through the scaffolding, and hear the familiar rattling of her pressure suit as it fired its thrusters and set down on the landing deck. Next she heard clicking in her helmet followed by a crew boss's voice "service debtors report to flight deck"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been about time for her rejuvenation, so debtor 492 was confused to find herself standing in front of unfamiliar door. Her guards had not activated a com channel for her suit, or removed her helmet once they were inside, so all she could do was follow where they motioned.

The door was not like any she could remember, she wasn't even sure were she was. The bay their shuttle had landed in _looked_ familiar, but they all looked the same. A thought began to form in her mind, brought to life by something very old in her, something long forgotten.....

The door opened and a willowy figure with bright —almost glowing— green eyes in black administrators robes motioned something to the guards. She heard her helmet latch open and a low chime signaled that she could take off her helmet.

"Come inside" Said the figure, her voice translated clearly in a dialect recognizable to debtor 492's ears. "You don't know me" she continued her voice made melodious to all who listen by protectorate technology "but I am your caretaker, I am the principle administrator of debtors here, you may call me director _Seti'yem_ and I know you. Do you know who are?" 492 didn't hesitate "I am debtor ONJ-45-355-737-617-49" "ehmhmmm..." said the administrator as she typed on what looked like a piece of glass. Without looking up from her typing she asked

"does the name Prix'vero Botha mean anything to you?"

When she heard the sound of her own name, the forgotten thing was no longer forgotten. "I...uhh...yes...that is my name I...uhh..think"


The administrator said the words "it is time for you to go free Prix'vero..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


She never talked about her past much when she joined the legion, and they didn't ask much. Even while the facts were read out to the arbiter general and all present in the grey tribunal hall heard the investigators say "Prix'vero Botha killed Betrano'deix, and injured several others, including her step-brother Geptur'verka Botha ..." there was nothing to say in her defense, the surveillance drones had seen everything, she had murdered an innocent. The arbiter stood, his grey cloaks hiding his many arms, and through his faceplate spoke "are you familiar with the justice of the protectorate?" he asked, his voice an electric trill through his universal translator "ah..a little...I've only been in the legion a year..." she started to reply until he interrupted "no matter, listen closely what I'm about to tell you is your right to know. The penalty for intentional murder is the same for all...you will spend the next one thousand adex in service to the Eradeus maxur were you will labor on great works" her blood ran cold...so she was to die in prison a slave she thought? What the arbiter said next, both answered and confused her, "while in the care of the Eradeus maxur, you will be given bio-resynchronization to ensure your continued health and life while carrying out your sentence, it is hoped that you will contemplate the sanctity of life durning your long labor...your are the benefactor of the strata dexo'mon which decrees, thats those with malevolent wills shall be invested in....at great cost, to do great things so that they may be healed. To this end, you will be indoctrinated into the cult of life"

the first 10

The work is unchanging, she was sad for a time, then angry. They are not given translators and it is rare to be able to talk to another with more than signals and body language during her free time. There is not much free time. She is sometimes moved to different hab units of the camp, each hab unit houses hundreds of debtors of many different species and matrices.

Life is regimented. She is awakened the same time every day and reports to the showers (if applicable) and then to the galley to eat, they are given 2 setadex (~32 minutes) to do this—some species are given leave for longer if biologically necessary—. Then they report to the work barracks and are sorted into work crews who board construction gondolas equipped with contra-grav thrusters and towing contra-grav trucks loaded with shield panels. Previous debtors had built the support towers which were planted into the core of Onjer'deresta, as well as the scaffolding and support grid for the shield panels which they were now laying.

After the gondolas have been loaded, they fly to that days building zone, and the debtors climb down onto either scaffolding deck, or already laid shield panel —which can support great weight without breaking— and would grab shield panels from a conveyer that would extend from the gondola and place it in an open grid slot.

After five interdex (~15 hours) of laying panels —with a brief meal break in the middle— they would be loaded back onto the gondolas and taken back to the barracks for their final meal of the day and then they would report to their bunks.

Every debtors bunk was equipped with a console that was hooked to a complete replica of the _Shard Accadatuas_, a massive sub library of the great _Stor Accadatuas_. The accadatuas contained all known works of literature from all of the vassal and ascendant states or the _Ogion Protectorate_ as well as frames of all known art. The same time each night it would play their assigned reading and imagery, they could mute it if they wished but they would still be assessed as if they had watched/read they were assigned. Twice a ritodex (~10 days) they report to guidance and spend that sleep cycle in a rejuvenation chamber. During guidance, they are asked questions by an automated system and assigned things to read.

Not all debtors adjust easily into their new life. All eventually do.

Escape is not even a thought. There is no were to run, and the administration controls the very air they breath at every instant. They are no fences or gaurd towers. Their is a legion presence for internal and external security. Insubordination, or disobedience is swiftly put down and the offenders given sedatives and extra guidance sessions. Twice a ritodex (~10 days) is the normal time for guidance sessions.

It was a bug hunt. I hate bug hunts, hive swarmers feel no pain, and dispense it without mercy. My job is much harder on bug hunts. What do they want with this shadt hole of a world anyway? It's not very green, the weather matches the landscape, bleak and uninviting. Despite the grey clouds, rain had not touched this dusty ground in a long time she guessed; there was plenty of lightning though, blue and white snaps that complimented the angles of the terrain. They had been sent to these mountains to find a local militia that had gone missing after they themselves had gone in search of a missing citizen. This mission will end like they usually do she thought —lots of dead bugs.

At least it's easy to tell friend from foe. Prix's eyes caught a spiny shadow moving far ahead of her squad.

"Dixo two, movement ahead"
Dixo: "copy"
_pfump pfump pfump brapp brapp_

The muffled reports of the exa'legionate's mag bolters mixed with the sharp bangs of the exploding bolts as they fired into a pouring swarm coming from the low rocks. That's 20..21..22 dead swarmers. Gotta remember to keep an eye on the rocks above...I can't see anything with all that interference. After what she estimated was at least 60 swarmers getting gunned down the din of gunfire abruptly stopped. The attack seems over.

"Squad hettra I see all vitals good, please confirm" All 14 green dots lit up in the lower right corner of her HUD. "Command we are all clear" Commander Ter Hemner should be pleased at our efficiency?

Not by his tone....
Hemner: "AIRBORNE INCOMING!"

 _CRAAACK_ She couldn't tell which other support exa'legionate fired the heavy bolter shot, but she followed its victim's fall backwards to the rest of the incoming airborne swarm. In a single movement she swung her heavy bolter up to sight and meet the incoming razor talons and spines with wings. _CRAAACK_ she put her bolt dead center through the nerve stem of one bug, and it tumbled forwarded and into the grey dust of the ground. _CRAACK_.._CRAACK_ two more down. exa'legionate mag bolters —sounding like small puffs compared to her long range rifle— joined into taking down the flyers. Seemingly syncronized with the flyers, ground swarmers charged out from the rocks and over the bodies of the bug soldiers that had attacked before. _BOOOMM_ _BOOOMM_ _BOOOMM_ Grenades drowned out the rest of the battle fire, and demolish the last flailing attack from the bugs.

 In the corner of her HUD two of the green lights turned blue, indicating minor wounds. Looks like I'm on the clock. She powered up her position translator and teleported into the cover of some rocks near the squad. A bright flash followed by a shrieking bang giving away her movement and destination. Opening eyes that she closed to ease translation disorientation, she felt the ground under her feet, stowed her weapon, deployed her medic shield, and turned to find the wounded exa'legionates.

The wounds were not bad, no sign of venom or acids, although the exa'legionates arm had been impaled, it would heal quickly after she worked on it; maybe this isn't so bad for a bug hunt after all? "Can you feel it anymore?" She asked after applying
