Hyperg'enot knights pilot revered machines called Jutero'maxu —maxu—. They are 10 meters tall, designed to destroy city buildings and obliterate infantry and armor. The maxu have a traditional loadout of a _sunfury_ war-lance, and _god-hammer_ gauntlet. A sunfury war-lance is ~12 meters long, on one end is long blade built around plasma lance cannon. On the other end is usually an autoglaive made up of three large (~2 meter) serrated blades. The plasma lance cannon fires a beam of super hot plasma up to half a let'con (~1/4 mile). The autoglaive can cut through most stone and steel.

Traditionally the war-lance is wielded in the right hand of the knight, while its left hand is covered in a god-hammer gauntlet.
The god-hammer gauntlet stored kinetic force wave energy which is unleashed on impact.
