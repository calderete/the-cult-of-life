## Ogion Conglomerate

While technically all divisions of the Ogion Conglomerate are for hire...It is only the services of the Honor Division that most can afford. Only the Primes can pay the bill for the Ogion's to deploy _any_ of their War Division into Honor service.

How an empire or conglomerate pays can vary...they can pay with resources, or planets and star systems, or even with service (a very few are deemed worthy to pay wit service)
