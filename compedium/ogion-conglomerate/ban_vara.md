## Tolls of the Ban Vara

War Dragon:

Plasmagneto bolter. Highly charged plasma bolts are formed in spinning magnetic-relativistic coils which are fed energy directly into the spinning breeches. The barrels are engineered to create a massive magnetic energy potential between the breech of the bolter, and the end of the barrel. The multi-part trigger first starts the breeches spinning which pulls energy from its frame and into the breech-coils, when they have spun up to sufficient energy, the wielder engages the second trigger and the plasma bolts are accelerated through the barrel at extreme speed. When the bolts impact a solid object the spinning magnetic field breaks apart the super-hot plasma violently while arcs of electrical energy go for ground where they can. Most organic beings will be severely wounded or killed if hit anywhere on their body by a plas-mag bolt. A plas-mag bolt not only incinerates flesh, but also electrocutes whatever it impacts, to various degrees.

In adept hands and implemented by master engineers, a single war dragon weapon, can discharge many rounds per second(inex) without reloading for hours




Ko'ton Maulers

Kinetic force wave discharger. This weapon forms a bolt of energy in the form of an exotic condesate that is intangled into a crystal structure. The condesate contains an immense amount of _Kinotons_...contructred particles that when they impact normal matter they imbue the impacted particles with kinetic energy, the result is the impacted matter flys away from the impact point with a force dependent on the impacted matter's mass and the energy of the bolt.

The crystals that keep the energy in its state have some flexibility and take the shape of the weapons barrel. The bolt can spread out to a defined width, or spread out indefinitely, loosing power as it spreads. While this weapon has unlimited range the crystals and condesate break up quickly and it looses power to do damage at long range.

The Kinetic force wave discharger creates the _Kinotons_ and exotic crystals inside a gravity forge that must be powered by a strong gravity well. The Ban Vara use a type of _Sege Star_ (caged black hole) for ammunition, less advanced implementations are mounted on starships. 

An unarmored target will have limbs ripped off and bones broken, an armored target will have its own armor turned into a weapon and causes great damage. Certain armors can blunt the force of this weapon, but they are of special design
