_"you do not remove the teeth of time by becoming immortal, you just level the playing field"_ - unknown

As promised the God King had come, and his armada blotted out the stars. Ogo'dredex fired it weapon with its sister moons Lat'dredex, Bran'dred, and Crep'dred. The four moons had orbited Drexas-Primus for a hundred million adex in the same orbit, the unnatural orbits held in place with macro grav anchors. For all that time they had been the most impenetrable guardians of the Etadex people, many of their vassals had adopted the symbol of the four moons and their planet, with each moon making the points of a diamond around Drexas-Primus. To the servants of the Etadex, the four moons stood for justice, strength, and progress.

Ogo'dredex, moon to Drexas-Primus
Drexas-Primus is inhabited by the Etadex ascendancy.

The Etadex were cybernetic beings, some organic structure around a large brain housed in a "skull". The have master living metal nano technology, and they can inhabit any sort of construct they wish. Some Etadex choose to live on Drexas-Primus in the _Argeos Hemodet Prix_, a network of permanent habitats and a virtual construct for their consciousnesses to live in and commune with others. Those that live in the _Argeos Hemodet Prix_ are called the _Hemodet_. The Etadex are governed by special _Hemodet_ called the _Tsi Drex_.

The Etadex are immortal, able to transfer their consciousness into a data cube, and if near network with sufficient bandwidth, transmit it to a remote location. Their consciousness can be reloaded into a fresh organic brain. Some Etadex stay virtual forever. At the time of the destruction of Drexas-Primus all Etadex were able to be immortal, something reserved for the elite of the Xerex.

The ancestors of the Etadex were called the Renton Protectors
The Renton Protectors were created by the Sai'du'bun

The moon was the last fortification to fall before Drexas-Primus, after it was taken its weapons were turned against Drexas-Primus. It was taken by the Xerex A'para which was hegomic cabal lead by the Xerex kingdom. They called them abominations of nature, citing their cybernetic nature of both machine and flesh.

The Xerex attack force consisted of the Xerex Immortal Army, and the Knigths of the God King, along with the Kings Admiralty, and the Countless Armada. Those alone were not enough to defeat the Etadex, they had subverted the machine empire know as the Nom'gicaa. The Divine King himself sailed with the Central Nexus of the Nom'gicca. The Nom'gicca brought all of their war assets...as it had been calculated that is would be necessary

The Omniscient Divine God King of the Xerex A'para, Sora'ditos Rehmet Ye'gen Tova(312th), Lord General Commander of the Immortal Myrmidons, High Knight Crusader of the Concardia Bastion, Immortal Lord of the Grand Council, Grand Ship-Master of the Admiralty, High Void Seer of the Eternal fleet.

Remohex, I fear Ogo'dredex will Fall. Because of Ogo's warning, we are spared the fate of her sisters...But now the Xerex seem intent to take this moon....they throw their death knights against us while their weaker forces wreak havoc on the people of Ogo and the native infantry and armor, without our support in these sorties, has taken heavy casualties. Her short range batteries are firing now, but they continue get transports through....every wave is 10,000 + armored landers, many make it through, and even a few can take out a battery...all of their knights...have painted their armor black...intelex tells me these are the elite...veterans of thousands of wars over many heptadex (10,000 adex: ~year)

Whoever these new allies are, if they were alone, we could take them, but the Xerex death knights continue to take a toll, despite heavy casualties. They carry out targeted strikes against the city infrastructure, despite Ogo'dredex engaging they still break through and have caused great damage.

The Xerex new allies are getting closer, and I am certain that with the next orbital cycle, they will conduct a co-coordinated attack and overwhelm our forces













The Etadex taught the rest of us a lesson with the eternal sisters, that relativistic kinetic weapons
