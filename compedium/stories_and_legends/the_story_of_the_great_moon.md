The great moon, was once a living guardian of a people called the Etadex. It and three other moons shared the same orbit of the Etadex home planet, which they named Drexas-Primus. At that time the great moon was called Ogo'dredex, and its sisters were named Lat'dredex, Bran'dred, and Crep'dred. For 80 million adex (~year) they orbited Drexas-Primus through peace and war, and whenever the horrors of the void descended on the heart of the Etadex, it was the eternal sisters that threw them back into the deep night.

Inside each moons core, were mounted four massive guns which were known as the _Exor_ battery, and was powered by a caged infinite gravity well (black hole). When fired, a metal round is accelerated by the _Exor_ shell drivers from the core, to the end of its barrel, to four fifths of the speed of light. The barrels which towered over the moons surface, and the shell drivers, were called the _Exor Loks_, and was controlled along with the moons _infra-perma_ by an Etadex mind which lived permanently within the moons _Eta cogi-vaults_.

In each moons core, in the opposite direction the barrels, extended another four barrels known as the _Gor Loks_. In each Gor Lok was a massive alloy weight which carried the energy of the gun recoil to surface against gravity and artificial arrestors. Each weight was crafted with channels and flutes to allow gas and plasma to flow past it and with every salvo an iridescent jet erupts from the surface of the _Gor Loks_ though the atmosphere and into deep into space while the recoil weights rise and then lower back to the core. Four additional smaller shafts ran at right angles of the barrels and recoil shafts, which were known as the _Dol Loks_, and were clear shafts in which additional ablator exhaust could vent.

The unnatural orbits of the four moons, was a feat of macro grav anchors which were powered by the same caged gravity well which drove the _Exor Loks_. Invisible conduits carried gravitonic energy down to the surface onto an equatorial structure which they called the _Hedem Hol'ax_. In this way the eternal sisters supplied energy...and light, to the Etedax people, even in the darkest of nights.

To the Etadex and their vassal states, the eternal sisters were working monuments of hope, progress, and justice.

Many kings, emperors, and warlords had coveted the knowledge of the Etadex, particularly their knowledge of transferring consciousnesses, which at that time was a rare feat for only the wealthiest of individuals. Some sought to force it from the Etadex, but any fleet that sailed into a salvo of Exor Loks shells would soon find itself shattered and burning.

Some cunning warlords, recognized the danger of the four bastion moons, and many attempts to sabotage the eternal sisters were made, only to fail...until the God King Rehmet Tova. A veteran of a failed campaign against the Etadex, he would return leading a cabal of greedy, power hungry, factions of conquest.

Rehmet Tova brought to the heart of the Etadex, his myrmidon drop ships, his Knights by the millions, and thousands of fleets. And yet his war assets, although vast, were not enough to take Drexas-Primus, for that he relied on his allies, and masters of living metal, the Nox'nol'giga.

Unlike the cybernetic Etadex, the Nox'nol'giga were pure machines with twisted wills they inherited from their long-usurped masters, and cared only for increasing their own wealth and influence. As masters of living metal, they could mimic even biological organisms, and it was the nol-corsairs, a feared mercenary faction of the Nox'nol'giga, that would become the slayers of the eternal sisters.

Through elaborate sabotage, and indoctrination of a few among the Etadex, the nol-corsairs rendered the recoil mechanisms unusable, melted in place with its own energy. With no-where for the recoil energy to go, the effect was to knock the moons from their orbits, and went crashing down into Drexas-Primus. The allies and patrons of nol-corsairs had ensured every _Exor_ battery was engaged,


 The central consciousness of Ogo'dredex after being warned by the governing consciousnesses of its dying sisters, raised an alert to the guardian forces, and after a fierce battle, the saboteurs were subdued.






The people of the Etadex ascendancy were cybernetic, many inhabited mobile machines of their own desire. An Etadex scientist would be outfitted with for deep void travel great speed and agility in planetary atmospheres of all compositions. They would also be equipped with advanced sub novum sensors. Other Etadex choose to be immobile and inhabit the Argeos Hemodet Prix, a complex where their organic minds are connected to the rest in the Argeos in a virtual world.

The Xerex




 During peace they served as a symbol to the Etadex and their vassal states, of justice, strength, and progress.
