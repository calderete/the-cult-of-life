The great moon, was once a living guardian of a people called the Etadex, it and three other moons shared the same orbit of the Etadex home world, which they named Drexas-Primus. At that time the great moon was called Ogo'dredex, and its sisters were named Lat'dredex, Bran'dred, and Crep'dred. For 80 million adex (~year) they orbited Drexas-Primus through peace and war, and whenever the horrors of the void descended on the heart of the Etadex, it was the eternal sisters that threw them back into the deep night.

Built inside of each moon was an _Exor_ battery which contained the barrels, shell drivers, and a recoil and exaust system for four massive guns powered by a caged infinite gravity well (black hole). The _Exor_ and the rest of the moons _infra-perma_ was controlled by an Etadex mind which lived within the moons _Eta cogi-vaults_ who they called the _Serek'sus Da'tess_ (guardian/provider mother of the void). They live a stoic existence, the last central-executive consciousness recorded: "...it is a sacred honor which can not be sought to be _Serek'sus Da'tess_...only now, that I've witnessed the harnessing of infinite energy...do I understand the miracle I have inherited..." in a seperate recording: "...I know of everything that happens on this moon...the potential of the Etedax, and all the vassal-peoples is truly limitless...and the acts of love and genius that take place on the land of which I am the steward...are humbling and an example to all who should know of them..."

Extendending from the core of the moon to the surface, and high above the artificial atmosphere of the moon where the gun barrels lined with the shell drivers, it was known the _Exor Loks_. When the _Exor_ batteries were fired, is a ccelereated by the _Exor Loks_ to four fiths the speed of light. Gravity waves and powerful magnetic fields emanate from the _Exor Loks_, and the areas around the towering gun barrels must be kept clear for dozens of tekudex in every direction. (tekudex = 5000 setta || ~1.5 miles)

In the opposite direction of the _Exor Loks_ barrels, extended another four barrels known as the _Gor Loks_. In each _Gor Lok_ was a massive alloy weight which carried the energy of the gun recoil to surface against gravity and artificial arrestors. Each weight was crafted with channels and flutes to allow gas and plasma to flow past it and with every salvo an iridescent jet erupts from the surface of the _Gor Loks_ though the atmosphere and into deep into space while the recoil weights rise and then lower back to the core. Four additional smaller shafts ran at right angles of the barrels and recoil shafts, which were known as the _Dol Loks_, and were clear shafts in which additional ablator exhaust could vent.

Although the shells fired by the _Exor_ batteries had the rest mass smaller than that of a shuttle, they impacted with devastating effect, the near luminal speed mass turned all they touched into bright star matter which was smeared across reality itself, with antimatter shrapnel carried far on ripples of gravity. Anything not damaged directly in a salvo would be baked in heavy radiation and unshielded electrical systems were overcharged from the destruction of the highly magnetized rounds. The wake of each shell also caused destruction, any small single person craft near enough to a rounds trajectory were often destroyed outright in the turbulent gravitic and magnetic forces that followed an _Exor_ shell.

The unnatural orbits of the four moons also served a purpose, and was a feat of macro grav anchors which were powered by the same caged gravity well which drove the _Exor Loks_. Invisible conduits carried gravitonic energy down to a surface equatorial structure which they called the _Hedem Hol'ax_. In this way the eternal sisters supplied energy...and light, to the Etedax people, even in the darkest of nights.

To the Etadex and their vassal states, the eternal sisters were working monuments of hope, progress, and justice.

Many kings, emperors, and warlords had coveted the knowledge of the Etadex, particularly their knowledge of transferring consciousnesses, which at that time was a rare feat that could cost worlds. Some sought to force it from the Etadex, but any fleet that sailed into a salvo of Exor Loks shells would soon find itself shattered and burning. The Etadex Gov.Primus Executor General noted:

"they seek immortality, but taking a mind, and plucking it from the real fabric on which it rests, and while sustaining it...place it into a permanent place outside of the body it was born in...that is a gift no one can be given...that is a prize that can not be stolen...for we know not the realities of alien minds..." << info and time

Some cunning warlords, recognized the danger of the four bastion moons, and many attempts to sabotage the eternal sisters were made, only to fail...until the God King Rehmet Tova. A veteran of a failed campaign against the Etadex, he would return leading a cabal of greedy, power hungry, factions of conquest.

Rehmet Tova brought to the heart of the Etadex, his myrmidon drop ships, his Knights by the millions, and thousands of fleets. And yet his war assets, although vast, were not enough to take Drexas-Primus, for that he relied on his allies, and masters of living metal, the Nox'nol'giga.

Unlike the cybernetic Etadex, the Nox'nol'giga were pure machines with twisted wills they inherited from their long-usurped masters, and cared only for increasing their own wealth and influence. As masters of living metal, they could mimic even biological organisms, and it was the nol-corsairs, a feared mercenary faction of the Nox'nol'giga, that would become the slayers of the eternal sisters.

Through elaborate sabotage, and indoctrination of a few among the Etadex, the nol-corsairs rendered the recoil mechanisms unusable, melted in place with its own energy. With no-where for the recoil energy to go, the effect was to knock the moons from their orbits, and went crashing down into Drexas-Primus. The allies and patrons of nol-corsairs had ensured every _Exor_ battery was engaged,

 The central consciousness of Ogo'dredex after being warned by the governing consciousnesses of its dying sisters, raised an alert to the guardian forces, and after a fierce battle, the saboteurs were subdued.






The people of the Etadex ascendancy were cybernetic, many inhabited mobile machines of their own desire. An Etadex scientist would be outfitted with for deep void travel great speed and agility in planetary atmospheres of all compositions. They would also be equipped with advanced sub novum sensors. Other Etadex choose to be immobile and inhabit the Argeos Hemodet Prix, a complex where their organic minds are connected to the rest in the Argeos in a virtual world.

The Xerex




 During peace they served as a symbol to the Etadex and their vassal states, of justice, strength, and progress.
