## Young Neta
### cover stuff


Neta Domiata was born on the planet _Daratia_. A paradise artificial world, were all she knows is lessons from her mother, running with her sisters in the _parkaria_, and occasionally seeing her giant brothers when they have to fix something. When not in her lessons or playing with her sisters, she is watching the sky and the moons _E'repedie_ and _Isiopophie_, and their ever changing arrangements with the three suns of _Daratia_

She is, like all _sonovians_ of her time an engineered being, and her makers the _Jin Mataratix_ have given her many abilities and instincts, and all _sonovians_ eventually feel their nature and the call of Iron.

Her mother's lessons start with science, art, and history, and as her body and mind become stronger, her mother begins to show her new skills, that will awaken her inner talents...it is only then that she will be ready, to begin the age of choosing.

_Sonovians_ that are born like Neta, are created to be soldiers of the void, a _Ban Vara_, powerful warriors capable of single handedly destroying capital ships and bringing down the gravest of threats. Not all _Ban Vara_ are _Sonovian_ but they are renowned among them, and are known in informal _Ogion_ as the "pincesses of war" (_Elixi Pri_).

From the _Ban Vara_ are recruited the Envoys and Operators of the _Ogion Protectorate_ who themselves are charged with bringing whole worlds to peace.

It is a high calling...but she is also a being of free will and the call of iron, is not the only one that she can answer.
