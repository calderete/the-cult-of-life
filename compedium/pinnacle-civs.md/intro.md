## Pinnacle Civilizations

Pinnacle civilizations are empires that have mastered all forces of nature and are immortal, they are also known as the primes. A primes core empire can span an entire galaxy and its influence spread even farther. In order to rule a galaxy prime civilizations have mastered faster the light travel and can harness the immense powers present in nature. The defining feature of any prime civilization is the absence of internal destruction. While not without internal conflict as there are many races and descendancies in a prime empire, for all of them war is a thing of the past....at least internally.

## Biological

This group of primes has mostly achieved immortality through the use of growing a biological body or housing and some means (often through technology) of transferring their individual consciousness to them. This transfer is often not necessary as these particular civilizations have mastered biological tissue regeneration. Some have a pastime of breeding giant interstellar pets/war-machines.

## Constructed Beings

These are the synthetic life form civilizations that are the descendants of machines that were originally created to serve a biological civilization. There are some that overthrew and exterminated their creators....others found a way to exist peacefully with the biologics of the universe. Their stories are as varied as they are incredible.

## Instanced Consciousness

The group of species that have ascended from the need of a physical body of any kind.
