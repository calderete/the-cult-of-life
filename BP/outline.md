### Overall

==============================

Three kingdoms of thousands of nations influence the Galaxy Gemi Holon. A powerful being rules over a world and is dethroned, many of her subjects rise to hunt her down and bring justice to the world Ver'mel. Amoung them is Prix. She has lost her friends, and her family has disowned her, so she joins her planet's saviors and becomes a trooper.

Unknown to the Protectorate and even the Ascendeti Qur'Xul is but a pawn to forces that wish "evolve" universe by rending it asunder, with the fabled, "Cold Light". But before that can happen the Agents of Chaos must remove the protectorate from power.
