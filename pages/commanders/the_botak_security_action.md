### The Botak Securtiy Action

War has lost it's glory. The thought sickened the commander. He would take no pride in what ever the outcome of the current caldex...he would not feel the feral rush of the old _War Blessing_, or a senior commanders paternal pride. No, even the inevitable feeling of accomplishment that accompanies mentoring soldiers and leaders had been taken from him in recent adexi. The war-steward stretago had seen fit to assign him war-strotium and columns whose ranks where filled with the most talented bringers-of-death-and-destruction this galaxy would ever see.

There where no real lessons of war left for him to teach such finely tuned wills of death.

And their potential adversaries while belligerent and determined as any this galaxy has birthed, where a young and inexperienced line. And if they turned....they would be nothing but ribbons in front of his strotium, the aptly named Battle-fleet _Blades of the Archons_.

From his observation deck with dozens of data consoles in from of him, and a neuro-com link to his top officers, the elite-executor-strotium-commander perceived, consciously and subconsciously every action and position of all elements under his command. It was not a great many assets to manage. Especially when compared to the impressive if primitive array of hardware positioned against them across the current star system.

Despite his cynical thoughts, the commander diligently scanned the data and com flows for strategic information and so he was aware of the request for secure com delivery from their charges.

His executor adjutant would be filtering out the tedious details of the message. She was a brilliant executor...nothing left for him to teach, the only worthy teacher for her now would be some far off future total-war.

"The unaligned leaders are rejecting the executor envoy's offers" His adjutant's message shown bright and with raised volume in his incoming neuro-com stream.

"The envoy's adjutant is predicting a total breakdown of talks"
"Understood executor-adjutant. We begin low-power stance change"
"Acknowledged commander"

An uncrackable subnovum neuro-stamp follows from his adjutant confirming his order to change the fleet stance with a request for his command key. Within a fraction of an imex he completes his reply and all battle platforms and ships under his command begin making preparations for battle.

The commander continued his scanning of data, his mind putting every intercepted unaligned communication into context with his recently acquired knowledge of the potential enemy war assets. His battle plan as always in these times depends on deep intelligence....and if that failed, there was always brute force.

Several million tekudex ahead of his command ship was an array of ~half a million ships and war platforms with weapons postured against a relatively small archon envoy pheaton. On board the pheaton the honored-envoy-of-peace, themselves a devotee of the cult of life, pleaded with the belligerent unaligned leaders.

"Designating enemy battle fleet botak"

His fleet had prepared as much as they could without further enflaming the brash _Botak_ battle fleet with telltale heat signatures from the archon weapon systems.

This fight would not be fair...he found himself half wishing that they listen to the envoy's pleas. There was always a chance the envoy pheaton could be damaged....
