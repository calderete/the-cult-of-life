### The Botak Securtiy Action

War has lost it's glory. The thought sickened the commander, he would take no pride in what ever the outcome of the current caldex...he would not feel the feral rush of having mastered death, or a senior commanders paternal pride. No, even the inevitable feeling of accomplishment that accompanies mentoring soldiers and leaders had been taken from him. The war-steward stretago had seen fit to assign him war-strotium and columns whose soldiers and pilots where the most talented bringers-of-death-and-destruction this galaxy would ever see.

There where no real lessons of war left for him to teach such finely tuned wills of death.

And their potential adversaries while belligerent and determined as any this galaxy has birthed, where a young and inexperienced line. And if they designate themselves as enemies of the Archon, he will feel no glory in their ultimate demise.

From his observation deck with dozens of data consoles in from of him, and a neuro-com link to his top officers, the elite-executor-strotium-commander perceived, consciously and subconsciously every action and position of all elements under his command.

Despite his cynical thoughts, the commander diligently scanned the data and com flows for strategic information, and so he was aware of the request for secure com delivery from their charges.

His executor adjutant would be filtering out the tedious details of the message. She was a brilliant executor...nothing left for him to teach...

"The unaligned leaders are rejecting the executor envoy's offers" His adjutant's message shown bright and with raised volume in his incoming neuro-com stream.

"The envoy's adjutant is predicting a total breakdown of talks"
"Understood executor-adjutant. We begin low-power stance change"
"Acknowledged commander"

An uncrackable subnovum neuro-stamp follows from his adjutant confirming his order to change the fleet stance with a request for his command key. Within a fraction of an imex he completes his reply and all battle platforms and ships under his command begin making low power preparations for battle. Within every war platform under his command, eyes began to regard their targets as prey.

The commander continued his scanning of data, his mind putting every intercepted unaligned communication into context with his recently acquired knowledge of the potential enemy war assets, his battle plan as always in these times depends on deep intelligence. The commander refocused the primary viewer to his main charge and regarded the scene filling up his view from the observation deck. Several million tekudex ahead of his command ship was an array of ~half a million ships and war platforms, their weapons postured against a gleaming speck that is the commanders most vulnerable charge, an archon envoy pheaton. On board the pheaton the honored-envoy-of-peace, who would be devotee to the cult-of-life, pleaded with the belligerent unaligned leaders to accept the terms given them, and vacate the space that was now under the agion protectorate. On that same pheaton was a device of far ancient origin......a panic button which when pressed summoned the envoy's custodians.

"Designating enemy battle fleet **Botak**" his adversaries had been named. The neuro-com highlighted and persisting the names importance to all on his command link. With the call sign designation the _Blades of the Archons_ had prepared for battle as much as they could without further enflaming the brash _Botak_ leaders with telltale heat from fully powered weapons.

The commander had a split second warning before before the alarms began and his consoles and viewers now showed what was a large confirmed enemy fleet. The pheaton was in retreat towards his position with several small specks following...sheild drones. To The Botaks credit they did not seem interested in the pheaton and were instead targeting his ships. He perceived massive heat signatures in one of the botak capital ships. It was a behemoth designated _reaper-1_ and was at least 4 tekudex in length with a massive plasma discharge weapon...truly world ending power.

The commander broadcast to his command channel "Broadcast war salutation and execute battle plan". From his command ship a universal transmission was made on all usable frequencies. Declaring all non aligned ships as enemies of the archon and strongly suggesting all enemy combatants with sense should surrender now...the commander has never known any race to head that suggestion. With his second order the blades-of-the-archon fully powered their weapons and began to spread out.

"Enemy weapons approaching full power. Are we to let them strike first commander?"
"Yes adjutant, let them have the first blow. They will be the ones to bring their fate upon them"
"Understood commander"

_Reaper-1_ fired it's weapon into a cruiser formation, a beam of charged plasma that could turn a moon to slag hit the subnovum shield of the lead attack cruiser. And that is when the botaks first saw archon tech in action as the beam was perfectly reflected off of the sub-kenetic matrix field. At first at an angle relevant to the angle it was hit, and then to the botak's horror directly back into their own ships.

A queue of conformations stacked up in the commanders nero-com and after a quick scan mass approved all attack plan orders. Status reports began flowing in seemingly only moments after the tell tale-flash of the Archon _Vengance_ class assault transports engaged their displacement fields to convey themselves to their prey.

The Status reports where all positive.
