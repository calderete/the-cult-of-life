## Holon, Angel's Cradle, Sector 1003, System Hkoth

#### Hkoth 4-2b, _Carta-romex_ District: 1489-BD

An operator is an everything.

In title, they are envoys of the Ogion principle command, and her orders come from the highest of the executive strata. Given that, in practice they are both an emissary of peace, and a machine of death. To the race-lines that have known them, they have been called angel, daemon, mentor and nemesis.

Right now she was death and moving.

She had warned them of this, after coming to this moon in the Hkoth system and been accepted as a mentor by the Batha (as the inhabitants of Hkoth 4-2b called themselves). Her universal translator had quickly indexed the language of the Batha, their physiology did not react adversely to the translator tech, and she had been able to communicate quickly, she had pointing to a sea called _The Ighthzx_ and said

"your ancestors knew the importance of knowing predator from prey, on this world there can only be so large a predator in _The Ighthzx_...."

"The void however is vast....to you and me right now, it is infinite. It has also existed for a great amount of time, and in that time there have grown many predators to match its vastness."

"There are dragons that could turn this sea to roiling vapor and the mountains to pools of glass" she had an immediate rapport with the Batha and her words had effect, confirmed by her _comdex_ reading unease among them.

"There are task masters with great machines that would carve this entire continent from the _planet-firma_ while their merciless _auto-harvesters_ wrecked this world. To them you would be a prized cosmic morsel and would consider your geologically diverse world a 'plump low-hanging fruit' to be plucked".

She had said more in her warning to the Batha.

"....slavery and annihilation are equally possible....they could strip a planet to its core....annihilation is preferred...."

What she was describing would have been dismissed by the _Batha_ as all very "magical" sounding before her arrival, but after some demonstrations and sharing of knowledge, they had no reason to doubt her words.

They were a noble people, but they could not hide the fear she had instilled in them, it was a manipulation, but Neta had learned that was part of her craft....it had worked out well though, at least given the _Batha's_ current situation.

She had warned them of exactly this, luckily for them it did not _appear_ as dire planet melting constructs.

As honored _envoy_ commander _Youhn-Xi Neta-Sutske_ moved and dispatched or disabled the hostile elements, she began to class her adversaries. She believed these to be slavers, not as horrifying an enemy than the prolific task masters, but they had struck with a rapid savageness that forced her to act as if they were very dangerous, and quickly.

As an operator the languages of diplomacy where innate, but as is so often with belligerent race-lines like the one she was fighting back now, they mistook her respect and lack of numbers as weakness.
