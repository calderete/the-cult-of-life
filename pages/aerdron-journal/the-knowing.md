### Gul Sùma also know as "The Knowledge" or "The Knowing"

Gul Sùma is believed to be a collective conscience of a lower level single cell type organism. This collective has evolved the ability to project its conscienceless and perception to seemingly any point in the known 3 dimensional universe. Exactly where the Gul Sùma biological self is located is not known. From interactions with Gul Sùma it is believed to be at an extremely distant point from surveyed space.

Gul Sùma is also known as "The Knowledge" or "The Knowing" (in addition to many other variations in many languages), this name was given due to Gul Sùma's ability to see the reality of anything, from the smallest to the largest scales.

There are assumptions that can be made about the biology and evolution of Gul Sùma, these ideas have been formed by studying the known conversations that the Aedron have had with Gul Sùma. It can be deduced that the Gul Sùma collective harnesses emnovite crystal to project its abilities and awareness. It is almost certain that it is a very very old genetic line, perhaps the oldest, descended from single cell lithiods.
