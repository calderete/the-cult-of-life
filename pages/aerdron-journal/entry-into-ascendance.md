#### Entry into Agion Phalanx

In order to be considered for entry into the Agion Phalanx a race or faction must demonstrate that the large majority of their population is a potential ascendant race/society. There are two traits that the vassal race must posses, the trait of the Ascender, and the trait of the Just. A society that posses the trait of the Ascender is one that is constructed as a meritocracy. For a society to be said to have the trait of the Just, it must be an objectively equal society.

Without the trait of the Just, there would be no even field for which the best and bJustest to rise, and without the trait of the Ascender they would not bear the fruits of their labor and sacrifice.  

**Meritocracy**

In order to be considered a meritocracy, a faction must led by those that represent the very best of their kind. Their leaders should exemplify intelligence, courage, honesty, and humility.

**Equal Society**
