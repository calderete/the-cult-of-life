### Into the Strata

**In the far distant future**
**Planet Septa 3**

FROM:<Master Battalion Commander 1st Class Thur Du-Horo>
DESTINATION:<Holon, Toopanum, Lulum, Septa 3>
ADDRESS:<Aulum, Haadup, Lancayum, Administrative Protectorate, A-345-672>
TO:<Agion Warrior initiate Neta Domica>
SUBJECT: Promotion to Able Soldier 10th class

Neta realized she had been staring at the subject line of her notification for some time....sitting in her quarters far away from the battalion command that sent it, the subject told her all she needed to know. I've made it she thought, I'm going into the strata....those words kept repeating in her head, words that every child hopes to breath into rarified air...I'm going into the strata. There are many ways to earn ones place within the collective strata, Neta earned hers through service of the Administrative Protectorate, keeping peace in the Shulags and gutters of her birth world, and rising in combat rank in the sacred Simulatorium.

I'm going into the strata.

Her mom is going to be so proud, her father too, the last one from their family to become a prime citizen was a generation ago. A bit of sadness entered her mind with thoughts of her family....somthing to talk to my advisory about during our next session

Immortality comes at great cost, and I will have to pay it.

I'm going into the strata.
Time to read the message.

"Open message", a list of her personal data instantly appeard followed by the lines that officially promoted her. Starting with her acceptance into the Warrior Strata.

"By order of the Warrior Directorate you are hereby assigned the Warrior strata rank of Able Soldier 10th class."
"By order of the Soldier Directorate your are hereby assigned the Soldier Strata rank of Infantry 10th class"

"ORDERS: Report to Army Administrative Complex Isel Lula for Embarkment no later than 5640-8-36 to accept your assignment" right next to the Lula beaches...maybe I'll go early..."Your Assignment will be the Logistical Frigate Shepard A43-F7 out-bound for Army Administrative Complex Hag-Furtu to then await deployment to Honor War Army: Hammer of Jinto, Battalion R-146" At the bottom was a blinking play button for a personal audio message with video. She pressed it and the text was replaced by the visage of a senior commander with eyes that seemed to see a hundred Adexi into the future.

"I am Honored Division Commander Goldof Shantake-Gor" It's hard to imagine what those eyes of Goldof Shantake-Gor have seen in his aeons of battle, but you got a sense of it with the gravitas of his voice. "on behalf the Agion Scepter Commander, and the Honored War Council, I thank you for your dedication as an Warrior initiate. Be proud of your accomplishment, you have proven yourself to be the best that your heritage can produce while carrying out good deeds for the innocent." An interesting way to sum up her 25 adexi fighting everything from petty crime to organized syndicates on Septa 3 "Now the Warrior Directorate calls on you to join us in our mission to protect the innocent, to strike down the enemies of the Directorate and to carry out the will of our masters the Primus Arkon" the honored commander's voice had been rising but lowered almost imperceptibly when the name of the Primus came out, hearing that name always gave her a sense of awe and dread ""
