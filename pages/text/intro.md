_"After many adexi cycle I have started to feel, that the only thing is know, is that we do not at all know what will be"_ - Elite Executor Column Commander Taga'tai-Laray

_"When a civilization presents the 'Advhat Appearance' of ascension, either achieved through universal communicators, or through evolution......they will face a turning point, into idyllic unity....or the hells of despotism"_ - Honored Ultra Savant, Lorato-vak

-----------------

Life - Some cosmic savants say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. It is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its command. All things, will _blindly_  follow the geometry of their fate until time itself freezes...unless life comes along.

In a barren system the only source of cosmic energy are the stars which burn there. Collections of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can only cause affect within the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight.

It is a miracle.

The furious light shines onto its daughter planets as they spin against cold space to create worlds of seasons, chaos, and birth.

If given time, life strives and gives rise to minds that may harness, and even outshine the cosmic light. Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.

---------------------------------------

One such life, an ancient and humble entity that was born into immense gravitation and radiation that will never cease. Through the aeons it was forced to thrive within the smallest of scales, and make countless preternatural biological leaps to survive and thrive.

Its existence is an ultra rare of the ultra rare, but also an inevitability in the life giving void. Inside its relativistic forge it evolved many singular talents. The best known of which is the ability to perfectly perceive everything, from the small to the macro, within a vast distance of itself.

Few sentient minds have mastered the art of querying and then deciphering the murmurings of this being. To those that can it calls itself _Gul Suma_ and _Gul Suma_ calls all other life the _bright wills_.

_Gul Suma_ sees its _bright wills_ as burning with uncertainty and chaos. Their courageous passions crafting great constructs where _Gul Suma_ knew there would else be naught but matter on its eternal cosmic dance.

The savants of the _Cult of Life_ know much and very little about _Gul Suma_, but Master Savant Cleder-Gosp knew enough to reflect on the irony, that for all that _Gul Suma_ knew, it does not know what its _bright wills_ do in its name. Cleder-Gosp thought this while studying a spectacle of destruction from his observatorium in the _Abrosh Tetra-Deck_ temple in the _Alanoth_ spire of the _The Eye of the Void_.

"Did you always think the contra-cults would still have as much influence as they do now?" he said to his companion in the observatorium, Master Savant Draga-Hekta

"I'm not surprised that old gods refuse to die, they always do, and as long as they live in the minds of the living, the contra-cults will have influence" she replied evenly

"I forget, there will always be those that follow false gods... it is unfortunate one of them happens to be _Gul Suma_" Cleder-Gosp replied "...after all this time we still see new contra-cults cause wreckage in his name, driven mad by knowledge they do not understand....and worshiping something that doesn't even know what 'worship' means..." after a pause he concluded "driven mad by their own dreams".

"You seem very certain it was a contra-cult of _Gul Suma_ that caused this?" she did not hide her surprise at his leap to a such a complete theory

"In this galaxy, only _The Children of Knowledge_ could cause this" he returned

An aberrant _nova-star_ which was often the herald of apocalypse and woe, had drawn them here and was now focused in the observatorium's central viewer.

It was a glowing orange object dotted with spots that from a distance gave it the look of a small but venerable star. It was not a star though, but a planet on fire. As Hekta watched it's roiling surface she began to quantify the energy it took to immolate, not just that what once lived on the surface, but the bed-rock itself until it boiled and belched clouds into its skies not seen on this world since its fiery birth.

If it kept this trajectory in the coming adex and tekadex this planet would see tempests and monsoons of searing metal and rock, it would cool eventually, as did all things.

Hekta was theorizing herself about what the intentions of these planet melters was. Her check in the archives revealed this was once a life-harboring world likely seeded via space borne dust and rocks, and had never emitted an unnatural electro-magnetic signal. When Draga-Hekta asked her fellow master savant what he thought of it, he replied....

"We had no relations or operatives on this world, and this whole galaxy is in the heart of the _Erappa_, so we only have conjecture. I'm sure its inhabitants had offended the contra-cult's doctrines in some way, perhaps it is simply an example?" Draga-Hekta knew this, but it needed to be said anyways, threads of genius lay in mundane questions.

"Perhaps" said Hekta as information and observations flowed into her mind through the neuro-com

"The master engineers report the surface is far too hot to have been only heated externally, they believe there to be an internal heat source" she informed him

"Intriguing, I will be interested to here there report after their meditations" replied Cleder-Gosp

"It almost never fails" continued Gosp "whenever there is a report of a _nova-star_ where there should not be, it is a sad ending"

"Indeed" said Hekta "this is more power than we've seen this far into the _Erappa_ by several magnitude, one moment...." The data nodes synced to Hekta's mind began focusing on something missing, "The reported energy spike was at the level of a _falling star_....". she said ".....where is the rest of it?"

"Perhaps that is what fuels the continued heating?" offered Gosp.

"from the aggregate sums I've reviewed this whole planet would be ionized vapor if it had absorbed that much energy" returned Hekta

"We will scrutinize the signs left in the local space, the nature of who was here and what process caused this will reveal your missing energy" said Gosp as he began to cycle up more consoles "the masters of war will have their own assessment as well given that many lives were likely lost here, the principle command will want a thorough report"

"The masters of war assess everything" said Hekta not without some chaff for her master-peers "if only it what was for more than by what means could something be obliterated, subdued, or _undone_ entirely"

"And yet so often...that is all that ones needs to derive the truth of a thing" returned Gosp. He was fresh off of a rotation in the _purgadtom_, and he had to yet to completely shake the mentality of war now that he was home in the _Abrosh Tetra-Deck_ temple with the cult savants.

"But not its story" countered Hekta.

Gosp said nothing else, but looked up to one of the many eyes set into her tall _Tsu'catan_ body, the descendant of thousands of void borne _race-lines_, and nodded and looked back to the slagged world as he approached his command console and began working.

Draga-Hekta returned to her own observatorium, one of many in the _Abrosh Tetra-Deck_ temple, which itself is installed in the top of the _Alanoth_ spire, one of many soaring spires on the massive _Ogion Plago_ construct _The Eye of the Void_. It had been given its name nearly a hundred metadex ago in the _Plago_ _Muduok Tora_ shipyards and measures almost 2 metradex in diameter from tallest spire to tallest spire. In size it rivaled most solid planetoids if not far short of their mass.

In her own observatorium Draga-Hekta cycled up her console and synced her _nero-com_. Within a few inex millions of _sub-novum_ sensors activated and began to take in the horrific sight. Their prying eyes fed data into Draga-Hekta's mind while far away in the depths of its gravity wells _Gul Suma_ perceived the same energetic violence and abrupt end of so many _bright wills_. They joined millions of minds on board _The Eye of the Void_ that for a short time, focused to record a world dying and rebirthing by unnatural causes.
