## The cult of life

**In the ultra distant future**

"_When a civilization presents the 'Advhat Appearance' of ascension, either achieved through universal communicators, or through evolution......they will face a turning point, into idyllic unity....or the hells of despotism_" - Honored Ultra Savant, Lorato-vak

-----------------

Life - Some cosmic savants say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. Life is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its command.

All celestial bodies, whether planetoids or diffuse dust and gas, will _blindly_  follow the geometry their fate until time itself freezes...unless life comes along.

In a barren star system the largest source of energy is the star itself. A collection of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can only cause affect within the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight.

It is a miracle.

The furious light, which for a time, will be a balance of gravity and pressure, renders its worlds with a great supply of energy to its surface that is set against cold space to create worlds of seasons, chaos, and birth. Once born life will strive and give rise to minds that may harness, and even outshine the forces that nurture it.

Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.

---------------------------------------

One such life, an ancient and humble entity, born into a young universe to scrape for prosperity bathed in immense radiation and gravitation that will never cease.

Forced to thrive within the smallest of scales, and make countless preternatural biological leaps for survival.

An ultra rare of the ultra rare, but also an inevitability in the life giving void, among other singular abilities it evolved to perfectly perceive everything within a vast distance of itself.

Few advanced _race-lines_ have mastered the art of querying and then deciphering the murmurings of this being. To those that can it calls itself _Gul Suma_ and _Gul Suma_ calls all other life the _bright wills_.

_Gul Suma_ perceives its _bright wills_ as burning with uncertainty and chaos. Their courageous passions crafting great constructs where _Gul Suma_ knew there would else be naught but matter on its eternal cosmic dance.

_Gul Suma_ does not know beauty, but the majority of the _Gul Suma_ family takes great pleasure when observing the _bright wills_. Their physical beings glow into the twilight when viewing the fleeting acts of  _bright wills_. Indeed to the gestalt consciousness of _Gul Suma_ they are sublime in their efforts to tame nature and master each other.

The savants of the _Cult of Life_ know much and very little about _Gul Suma_. Master Savant Cleder-Gosp reflected on on some of that knowledge while studying a spectacle of destruction from his observatorium in the _Alanoth_ spire of the _The Eye of the Void_.

"Did you always think the contra-cults would still have as much influence as they do now?" he said to the only other occupant in the observatorium, Master Savant Draga-Hekta

"I'm not surprised that old gods refuse to die, they always do, and as long as they live in the minds of the living, the contra-cults will have influence" she replied evenly

In the cruel realities of the universe, the siren song of savior angels, gods, and superstitions ensnares many sentient minds and plants its roots deep.

Over time, when susceptible minds encounter beings that have mastered light and mass, they can be overwhelmed, and perceiving their mastery of nature to be unnatural magic, they add them to their pantheon of gods. In a great many cases the newly anointed deities will reject their god-hood, or simply never know about it, religions will flourish regardless of their participation.

_Gul Suma_ was a member of many such pantheons

"I forget, there will always be those that follow false gods... it is unfortunate one of them happens to be _Gul Suma_" Cleder-Gosp replied "...after all this time we still see new contra-cults cause wreckage in his name, driven mad by knowledge they do not understand....and worshiping something that doesn't even know what 'worship' means..." after a pause he continued "it is as if, they are driven to madness by their own dreams" Draga-Hekta detected no anger or sadness in his words, but she knew it was there.

She knew this because of what they were regarding while they spoke in the observatorium. What was reported to the _Ogion_ principle command as an aberrant _nova-star_....often, the herald of apocalypse and woe, had drawn them here and was now focused in the observatorium's central viewer.

It was a glowing orange object dotted with spots that from a distance gave it the look of a small but venerable star. Except that was not really a star, but a planet totally on fire.

As Hekta watched it's roiling surface she began to quantify the energy it took to immolate, not just that what once lived on the surface, but the bed-rock itself until it boiled and belched clouds into its skies not seen on this doomed world since its fiery birth.

If it kept this trajectory in the coming adex and tekadex this planet would see tempests and monsoons of searing metal and rock, such was the churn of its once core....it would cool eventually, as did all things.

"You seem very certain it was a contra-cult of _Gul Suma_ that caused this?" she did not hide her surprise at his leap to a such a complete theory

"In this galaxy, only _The Children of Knowledge_ could cause this" he returned

Hekta was theorizing herself about what the intentions of these planet melters was. According to the archives this was once a life-harboring world. When Draga-Hekta asked her fellow master savant what he thought of it, he replied....

"We had no relations or operatives on this world, and limited presence in this whole galaxy, so we only have conjecture. I'm sure its inhabitants had offended the contra-cult's doctrines in some way, perhaps it is simply an example?" Draga-Hekta knew this, but it needed to be said anyways, threads of genius lay in mundane questions, that was why she was here.

"Perhaps" said Hekta as information flowed into her mind through the neuro-com

"The master engineers report the surface is far too hot to have been only heated externally" she informed him

"Intriguing, we will see if their meditations on this event yield any _original knowledge_" replied Cleder-Gosp

The data columns synced to Hekta's mind began focusing on something missing, "The energy spike we saw was at the level of a _falling star_....". she said ".....where is the rest of it?"

"Perhaps that is what fuels the continued heating?" offered Gosp.

"from the aggregate sums I've reviewed the planet would not exist if it had absorbed that much energy" returned Hekta

"We will scrutinize the signs left in the local space, the nature of who was here and what process caused this will reveal your missing energy" said Gosp "the masters of war will have their own assessment as well given that many lives were likely lost here"

"The masters of war assess everything" said Hekta not without some chaff for her master-peers "if only it what was for more than by what means could something be obliterated, subdued, or _undone_ entirely"

"And yet so often...that is all that ones needs to derive the truth of a thing" returned Gosp. He was fresh off of a rotation in the _purgadtom_, and he had to yet to completely shake the mentality of war now that he was home in the _Abrosh Tetra-Deck_ temple with the cult savants.

"But not its story" countered Hekta.

Gosp said nothing else, but looked up to make eye contact to one of her many eyes set into her tall frame, her body the product of thousands of void borne _race-lines_, and nodded and looked back to the slagged world as he approached his command console and began working.

Draga-Hekta retreated to her own observatorium, one of many in the _Abrosh Tetra-Deck_ temple, which itself is installed inside the massive _Ogion Plago_ construct that had been christened _The Eye of the Void_ nearly a hundred metadex ago in the _Plago_ _Muduok Tora_ shipyards. Almost 2 metradex in diameter from tallest spire to tallest spire it rivaled most solid planetoids in size if not far short of natural mass.

Draga-Hekta settled into her own observatorium and brought up her console and activated millions of _sub-novum_ sensors to begin taking in the horrific sight with their prying eyes.

Far away in the depths of its gravity wells _Gul Suma_ perceived the same death and abrupt end of many _bright wills_ ignorant that it was done in its name. _Gul Suma_ did not see any of the normal rise in chaos, or gradual decline that comes before such a total ending of life. Instead it saw them mingling among each other, and then flashes and dancing of cosmic scale energy ending with the planet boiling. The great spinning hot rock did not have the same passion and chaos that it once did, but its great change was unusual to the _Knowing_ and so it watched with interest.

_Gul Suma_ joined Draga-Hekta and a million other minds on board _The Eye of the Void_ that for a short time, focused to record a world dying and rebirthing by unnatural causes.

#### Micro Definitions

**Nova-star:** Informal for a star death-burst.

**Falling-star:** Informal for an object (usually a star) collapsing into a black hole

**undone:** Informal for something destroyed by a _Beam of fate_ or similar type weapon

**Sub-novum:** The smallest of scales/dimensions where time and distance can become blurred. For ascendant _race-lines_ it is only a realm of possibility and even construct. ("Quantum")

**Gul Suma:** Other names for Gul Suma: _The Knowing_, _Knowing_, _The All Knowing_,....and many variations which are further listed in the _Store Accadatuas+_ data vaults. Many names are translated names of mythological gods.

**Store Accadatuas:** The _Cult of Knowledge_ maintains the massive data library known as the _Store Accadatuas_ which is charged with persisting all possible knowledge gathered by the ascendant cults. The _Store Accadatuas+_ is often referenced in citations, such as: "CA-C: Nokchta-Roko, 5-17-54-1009"

**Advhat:** The Honored Ultra Savant Serjonus Hautus Advhat Soktum (name shortened) codified into the cult of the life, the long held belief that achieving true translation, and thus access to understanding of the minds of other living things is essential to _Ascension_.

**Beam of Fate:** A high energy weapon that defies the laws of reality and strikes instantaneously regardless of range. Its range is dependent on the power of the particular weapon. They take tremendous power and are enormously dangerous to operate, and if not engineered correctly will back fire catastrophically. Only the _Ogion_ field such weapons, and even then it is extremely rare.
