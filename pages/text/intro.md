## The cult of life

**In the ultra distant future**

"_When a civilization presents the 'Advhat Appearance' of ascension, either achieved through universal communicators, or through evolution......they will face a turning point, into idyllic unity....or the hells of despotism_" - Honored Ultra Savant, Lorato-vak

Life - Some cosmic savants say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. Life is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its will. All celestial bodies, whether planetoids or diffuse dust and gas, will _blindly_  follow the geometry their fate until time itself freezes...unless life comes along.

In a dead star system the largest source of energy is the star itself. A collection of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can only cause affect within the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight.

It is a miracle.

It sets in action the environment for life. And when there is life, great minds and societies may rise to harness, and even outshine those same forces. Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.


---------------------------------------
One such life, an ancient and humble entity, born into a young universe to scrape for prosperity bathed in immense radiation and gravitation that will never cease.

Forced to thrive in the smallest of scales, and make countless preternatural biological leaps for survival.

An ultra rare of the ultra rare, but also an inevitability in the life giving void, it evolved to perfectly perceive everything within a vast distance of itself.

Few advanced _race-lines_ have mastered the art of querying and then deciphering the murmurings of this being. To those that can it calls itself _Gul Suma_ and _Gul Suma_ calls all other life the _bright wills_.

_Gul Suma_ perceives its _bright wills_ as burning with uncertainty and chaos. Their courageous passions crafting great constructs where _Gul Suma_ knew there would else be naught but matter on its eternal cosmic dance.

_Gul Suma_ does not know beauty, but the majority of the _Gul Suma_ family takes great pleasure when observing the _bright wills_. Their physical beings glow into the cold void when they are perceiving their fleeting acts. Indeed to the gestalt consciousness of _Gul Suma_ the _bright wills_ are sublime in their efforts to tame nature and master each other.

The savants of the _Cult of Life_ know much and very little about _Gul Suma_. Master Savant Cleder-Gosp reflected on on some of that knowledge while studying a spectacle of destruction from his observatorium.

"Did you always think the contra-cults would still have as much influence as they do now?" he said to the only other occupant in the observatorium, Master Savant Draga-Hekta

"I'm not surprised that old gods refuse to die, they always do, and as long as they live in the minds of the living, the contra-cults will have influence" she replied evenly

In the cruel realities of the universe, the siren song of savior angels, gods, and superstitions ensnares many sentient minds and plants its roots deep.

Over time, when susceptible minds encounter beings that have mastered light and mass, they can be overwhelmed, and perceiving and believe them to be born of the supernatural, and add them their pantheon of gods. In a great many cases the newly anointed deities will reject their god-hood, or simply never know about it, religions will flourish regardless.

"_Gul Suma_ is not like those false gods..." Cleder-Gosp replied "...after all this time the contra-cults cause wreckage wherever they go, driven mad by knowledge they do not understand....and worshiping something that doesn't even know what 'worship' means..." after a pause he seemed to come to a conclusion "it is as if, they are driven to violence by...their own dreams" Draga-Hekta detected no anger or sadness in his words, but she knew it was there.

She knew this because of what they were regarding while they spoke in the observatorium. An aberrant nova-star....often the herald of apocalypse and woe, had drawn them here.

Upon arriving the central viewer focused on a glowing orange object dotted with spots that gave it the look of a small but venerable star.

Except that is not a not really a star.....but a planet... a planet totally on fire. As Hekta watched it's roiling surface she struggled to quantify the energy it took to immolate, not just that what once lived on the surface, but the bed-rock itself until it boiled and belched clouds into the skies not seen on this doomed world since its birth.

If it kept this trajectory in the coming adex and tekadex this planet would see tempests and monsoons of searing metal and rock, such was the churn of its once core....it would cool eventually, as did all things.

"I am surprised they can bring this much power to bear." she admitted

What this contra-cult, intended with the melting of this once life-harboring world, the cult savants did not know. When Draga-Hekta asked her fellow master savant what he thought of it, he replied....

"This world was not known to us until it burned, I'm sure its inhabitants had offended the contra-cult's doctrines in some way, perhaps it is simply an example"

"Perhaps" said Hekta as information flowed into her mind through the neuro-com

"The master engineers say that the planet is being heated from the inside, they report the surface is far too hot have been only heated externally"

"I've heard of weapons that could do this, the cult of war will know more" replied Cleder-Gosp

There was still some missing energy thought Hekta, "The energy spike we saw was at the level of _falling star_....". she said ".....where is the rest of it?"

"Perhaps that is what fuels the continued heating?" offered Gosp.

"from the sums I've reviewed the planet would not exist if it had absorbed that much energy" returned Hekta

"We will scrutinize the signs left in the local space, the nature of the weapon will reveal your missing energy" said Gosp "the masters of war will have their own assessment as well I would hypothesize"

"The masters of war assess everything" said Hekta not without some humor in her voice "if only if what was for more than by what means could something be obliterated, subdued, or _undone_ entirely"

"And yet so often...that is all that ones needs to derive the truth of a thing" returned Gosp

"But not its story" offered Hekta

Gosp said nothing, but looked up to make eye contact with her tall void born frame and nodded and looked back to slagged world as he approached his command console and began working.

#### Micro Definitions for +

Gul Suma: Other names for Gul Suma: _The Knowing_, _Knowing_, _The All Knowing_,....and many variations which are further listed in the _Store Accadatuas+_ data vaults. Many names are translated names of mythological gods.

Store Accadatuas: The _Cult of Knowledge_ maintains the massive data library known as the _Store Accadatuas_ which is charged with persisting all possible knowledge gathered by the ascendant cults. The _Store Accadatuas+_ is often referenced in citations, such as: "CA-C: Nokchta-Roko, 5-17-54-1009"

Advhat: The Honored Ultra Savant Serjonus Hautus Advhat Soktum (name shortened) codified into the cult of the life, the long held belief that achieving true translation, and thus access to understanding of the minds of other living things is essential to _Ascension_.






===============================================
## Snippets graveyard

The _Cult of Life_ knows much and very little about _Gul Suma_, it does not know which world the being known as _Gul Suma_ resides. The cult savants do know it refers to light by its constituent wave-particles which it calls _timeless motes_, and anything made of real matter _weighted motes_.

When successfully queried if _Gul Suma_ considered itself a _bright will_? _Gul suma_ has responded yes, but one that is of the fringe length of persistence, and lack of physical constructs. As a follow up when asked if _Gul Suma_ would always be? The reply was "as long as _weighted motes_ move, and can be grasped, _Gul Suma_ will be and know all to the edge"
