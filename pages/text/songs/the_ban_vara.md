_"The could be angel or demon...that depends on you..."_

Ban Vara wait in the void, quite and watching

They see all but judge none

Ban Vara ponder and report to their masters

They strike when called

_Lat'rel brought fire to the Dread Ones
The hero of Ya'tacu plucked them from the sky
Lat'rel pointed to Godorix the butcher
And before her feet touched the ground
Lat'rel sent him to his gods

Dread Knights know not surrender
Dread Knights know only blood and fire

Lat'rel gave them blood and fire_ - translated from Hyper-Kon, poet of the Eglise'es

_We Go On_ song of the Sotor Gim'det

We go on
We go on

It was not the end
First comet emptied our ocean,
and washed our shores away

First comet put fire to our sky,
and sheathed our cradle in smoke
It was not the end

We go on
We go on

It was not the end
Second comet emptied our hope
and washed our fears away

Second comet put courage in our minds
and blew the smoke from our hearts
It was not the end

We go on
We go on
