_"The could be angel or demon...that depends on you..."_

Ban Vara wait in the void, quite and watching

They see all but judge none

Ban Vara ponder and report to their masters

They strike when called


_Lat'rel brought fire to the Dread Ones
The hero of Ya'tacu plucked them from the sky
Lat'rel pointed to Godorix the butcher
And before her feet touched the ground
Lat'rel sent him to his gods

Dread Knights know not surrender
Dread Knights know only blood and fire

Lat'rel gave them blood and fire_ - translated from Hyper-Kon, poet of the Eglise'es
