The Silver Queen of Ver'mel was gone. This time was never to come, the diamond spire was forever; now a broken shard, the "Laughing Empress" banished. In the end, she was not a living god, only a person like any other among the stars.

To her subjects she was the "Laughing Empress". and she did not leave without a parting gift. In the final moments of her banishing battle, she threw open the Ver'kuma gate that she once had sealed, and the giant conquerers within once again poured through to reap an ancient tithe. Before it could be closed, a million souls vanished through it. Among them was a daughter of the Huso, Prix'Vero Botha.

In the bowels of the Hypergenot slave ship Glory Seeker, the abducted slept and lived in rows and stacks of cages. It was putrid place with the sounds of the suffering filling every cage. Every captive is drugged with memory inhibitors when taken. Their amnesia making them more pliant. Nearly all of the newly enslaved awake with the same confusion and disabling terror in the "Cattle Hold" —as it was called— and they add to the chorus of pleading wails.

The salvers called themselves the Dre' and they were a people of purpose.

Prix awoke in this alien place, to a familiar Dwelvish accent. "Eh, eh...Husi? You alive?" she opened her eyes to hazy multiple vertical slices of shadow through light. A blob of shadow seemed to speak as it grew larger, she heard other sounds around her —low moaning and retching. "ahhh yea, you is alive, wouldn't be in this cattle hold if you were'nt." She pushed herself up to sit; her vision started to cleared and she tried to speak; only rasps came out. "Ehhh, that'll pass Husi" The dwelf poked a steel cup through the bars separating them, she took it and drank gratefully. He was common looking dwelf, about half her height; stocky and wide. He wore a trimmed beard of ornate shapes —in the style of his people— and his pointed ears poked through his dark brown hair. Her throat absorbed the water like parched sand soaking up rain, when she tried to speak again, the rasp only colored her words instead of stopping them. "Thank you, my name is Prix'Vero Botha"
"Aye, well met Prix, I be Rippin Bomba"
"Your a dwelf?"
"Aye and your a Husi, still caged like me though..."
"Do you know were we are?"
"Humpf, ever heard of the Gobby Knockers, or the Street Wraiths?"
"No"
"Ha! You Husi all think your so smart.....I don't right know were we be, but there is a legend on me island about the Gobby Knockers. Legend says they would take away gullible travelers never to be seen again."
Her eyes had recovered more and she looked around her, there were stacked cages as far as she could see. The cage opposite the dwelf cage was empty, and beyond she could see looked lumps of others sleeping. She had been fighting a panic since awaking, and it swelled in her now, she could feel tears creep into the corners of her eyes; she had been with Des'toria, and Grada'Poc walking across the Jempata Bridge, there was news and celebrating at the Tri'dol square; then there was heat, and light, and then nothing —until she heard the dwelfs voice.
"Somethin tells me...you best not let anyone see you cry here."
"Why do you care master Dwelf?"
"Master eh? Hehehe...not often you hear a Husi speak so to a little dwelf like me."
"I'm not like my people, I'm not like the ones that have committed crimes on your people"
"Aye indeed! I can see you are not like your people....so large and strong, you are very young or very stupid, maybe both hehe."
"I am Prix Botha" Her voice shook but her tears had stopped.
"Maybe, that is why you are here Prix Botha..."

Before she could respond a klaxon blared from audio emitters she had not seen in the top of every cage. A voice followed the klaxon, each cage outputting a translated message in a monotone mechanical voice.

"Welcome to the Seeker of Champions. Be at peace, for you are free. Free from want, free from choice; free from all but glory. Your destiny and your death is now, and forever the honor of the Hypergenot. Glory eternal to the Diasa. Glory Eternal to the Hypergenot"

A deep, slow drumming began building in volume, the cages all around Prix rattled in time. Prix looked across from her row; the cages formed chrome chasms 10 meters across. The occupant across from her looked to Prix somewhat like a Vetarian —the sea people— on Ver'mel, only with more tentacles and 2 heads. While unfamiliar with what it was, she was certain it was terrified. The drumming was getting loader, and she could hear panicked sounds below, a light was glaring from far off her left. The lights grew brighter, and the drums grew louder.

Chrome plates flew from above and below the chasm in front of her cage, interlocking into a level solid walk. The drums thrummed through her body and mind drowning out every thought that tried to form. The source of the light stepped into her view; large 2 legged, 2 armed hulks of gold and brass armor held aloft burning torches —which would burn the eyes if more than glanced at. The hulks had horned and plumed helmets; of black iron, gold, and reddish brass. Either by order or choice, no two torch bearers were equipped the same. Behind them was a helmet-less hulk borne on chair that seemed to float on fire and light; his armor was more fine cloth than plate, on his fingers he wore weighty rings. As he floated in front of Prix's cell his head swiveled from cage to cage; every red-eyed, half-lidded, glance weighed and tried each prisoner. His head turned on her, and inclined slightly. Prix's heart stopped before racing in fear as the seated hulk raised one, jewel glinting, hand from his robes and pointed at her. Green lips drew back revealing sharp, yellow-white teeth. A deep voice rumbled from behind the teeth —loud enough for her to hear through the overpowering drums— carrying words she did not understand. She did not need to, she knew she was not staying in that cage.

The bars caging her flew open leading to the plate walk. Torch bearers lined each side of the cage exit. From behind the seated hulk six four legged rat-like creatures —each at least 1.5 meters long and .5 meters at the shoulder— waddled into the cage and began pushing and pulling her out of it. She stood as far as she could and followed where the rats lead her. They guided her —nudging, pulling, and sometimes snapping— through the torch bearers and behind the seated hulk. There, was a floating topless cage chained to the floating throne. More armored hulk, bearing heavy blades instead of torches, opened the cage as Prix was pushed in with others.

Ganto was a team sport, that could wind up a one on one match. It was times like those that Prix excelled. It was the final regional match of the season, the winner would go on to the kingdom championship. The opposing team had lead for most of the match, dispatching 4 of her 9 team mates within moments of the first round. It had then been a grueling 5 minutes as her team —the Sen'Lon Comet-stars— regrouped and fought hard to match the Fara'Het Dragons kill for kill, point for point; and then Prix turned the tide, knocking out all but one of the Dragons. The match was now mats'vie —a final one on one match, no time limit. The final Fara'Het Dragon heard his teammates demise and had doubled back a long way to try to out flank an attack by the final Comet-star. But Prix —who had been nicknamed Ez'Rapta after the fierce mountain tigers— would not be outflanked.

Neither Prix or the final Dragon could hear the roaring crowd from beyond the battle-dome; they could not hear the chants of "Rapta! Rapta! Rapta!" as Prix stalked the Dragon. Over the chants of the cheering of the crowd, an amplified voice called out the action of the match ensuring that all would feel this drama, "The dragons have been slain by the tiger! A fight as old as time! Who will prevail! The Great dragon, or the cunning Tiger?!". The dragon moved quietly, listening for Ez'Rapta —and heard nothing. Then, as he turned to loop around his original path, he heard her land behind him. He ducked as he spun, her club whooshing through the air were his head had been. He continued his spin and struck blindly at her attacking hand, landing the blow. She growled as her club bounced off the ground. The dragon seized on the opportunity and raised his own club while closing the distance to Ez'Rapta, not seeing the hollow metal ganto ball in her hand. Before his first charging step hit the ground the ball struck him between the eyes, stunning him for a split second, he could not react to Prix grabbing his club wrist, stepping behind him and throwing him to the ground; all breath left him as he struck the ground. He could see the killing blow coming with his own club; still struggling for breath, and anticipating a head blow, he closed his eyes. Ez'Rapta —mercifully— brought the club down on his chest-plate ending his, and his teams, match.

The Dome opened and the roaring of the crowd shook the Ganto battle grounds. As the match-ending kill, the final dragon had not been rendered unconscious; Prix offered her hand to him with words of sportsmanship, "That was a really good strike, I almost thought you had me." The dragon met her eyes, "Thank you for not going for a head blow." The dragon left to rejoin his rising teammates, Prix's own teammates had regained consciousness and were swarming her. The amplified voice recounted the drama of the last seconds of the match, "The vaunted skill of the dragons has encountered the fearless master of combat Ez'Rapta..."
