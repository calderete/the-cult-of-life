Prix of the exa'legionate

The protect its vast frontier, the Primea'Cosmicae Protectorate uses the vast Segetum Legionatus —the legion. Volunteers and conscripts to the legionatus are given safety, comfort and health —things most rare among the stars— in exchange for service in one of the the many arms of the Legionatus. Thousands of organizations, knows as statora make up the Legion. Every statora has a mission, which may be to protect a planet, or a certain space or people. Any protectorate vassal citizen —regardless of biology or background— can join the lower statora, or lower legion. The largest, most sprawling of the lower legions is the Regatius Exa'Legionatus; the expeditionary, the _exa'legionate_. The exa'legionatus is charged with responding to dangers on the frontier when local vassal forces are overwhelmed. They are strike and recon force, and are equipped to handle to majority of dangers faced on the frontier. While they do not field armies of millions like the Dexa'Legionatus, the vastness of the frontier requires hundreds of times the troopers than any other lower legion.

The ranks of exa'legionatus are filled —from all the corners of the cosmos— with the courageous, the broken, and the lost.

The exa'legionate cruiser _Fenra Glory_ journeyed at incredible speed. Its sub-novum* drive carried its crew, and thousands of sleeping troopers through a sub dimension at many times the speed of light. Like all ships of its class, the _Fenra Glory_ was not a thing of beauty but function; which was to transport troopers to where they were called —quickly. It had been sailing through the under-space of reality for 12 days —covering thousands of lightyears in that time. As the normal-space translation point neared, the commander-captain of the _Fenra Glory_, Velix Ri'torio, hailed exa'legionate arch'commander Tero Hemner through her ship's neuro-com.
"Commander Hemner, we approach your mission point"
"By your leave captain, I will activate the troopers"
"How many will you be landing?"
"5 strike squads with extra resources"
"extra?"
"Two gunners and one support each"
"This is not likely a hive. Just some blown adrift, or stowaway breshe'swarmers."
"I agree"
"We must find where they are concentrated, where their swarm point was"
"We will"
"These breshe may only be adrift, and with only a ground-queen, but sooner or later, they will raise a full-queen. Then we _will_ have a hive to deal with"
Hemner saluted the more senior and honored Captain and gave assurances that his exa'troopers would not rest until they had found their objective.

The captain was pleased that Tero Hemner did not need to be reminded —as he sometimes did— that he was a commander of strike and recon soldiers, and not a domineering force like the PanCosma —Ometi— guard from which he spent most of his legionatus career. Velix Ri'torio activated her command console, and began issuing orders to prepare to unlock and land troopers.

As Hemner returned the barrack decks, he focused on his breathing to curb his natural aggression which clouded the mind. Once he was calm he began —in his organized and disciplined way— to mentally enumerate the necessary preparations for his mission.

On barrack deck eleven of the Fenra Glory, the exa'legionate support trooper —ada class— Prix'Vero Botha, callsign Botha 9, slept in her hibernation pod, and dreamed of memories of the home she had left. They were not good memories. When her hibernation pod began to wake her, she felt no longing to return to her dream. Her hibernation pod injected her with a cocktail of rousing and rejuvenating drugs. A soft chirping alarm began building in her ears. Prix opened her eyes and the chirping stopped, and was replaced the voice of the hibernation AI. "Hello exa'legionate trooper, ada class, Prix'Vero Botha. How do you feel?"
"Functional" Prix rasped groggily.
"Confirmed" Not a hing of humor from the AI. "Muster in 15 minutes on muster deck 4, reporting to arch'commander Tero Hemner"
"Confirmed"
Prix wasted no time after her pod opened and her life support connection released, fueled by stimulates and a desire to get away from were she had just been dreaming, she followed the other waking troopers to the bunk decks for a change of clothes and a shower. She passed some familiar and unfamiliar faces, she nodded the same at each of them. A striking trooper with a green face with purple spots, held her gaze briefly. She had black and purple eyes, to match her spots. Prix had not seen her before, she hoped to see her again though.

Arch'commander Tero Hemner was already at his podium at the muster deck. From his raised platform above the wide open area, he held court with armorers, mechanics, and logistical specialists, each receiving their charges, and tasks from the young, but able commander. The armorers and logi-specialists departed and returned with racks and carts laden with the wares of war, and the mechanics left to make final checks on the drop ships. Behind the armor racks came mess tables which were set in rows on the muster deck. When the first troopers began filing in, panels in the back wall rose to reveal a mess-line, stocked and stinking with foods from all corners of the cosmos. "An army runs on its stomach"

The Arch'commander observed his troopers. Measuring, weighing. He barely registered their faces, instead as his eyes tracked their movements through the mess lines and tables, and recalled

She was a reformaent, an ex-criminal who had paid their debt to society and was trying to re-enter the citizenship of the protectorate. Her crime had been murder, and for it she was sentenced to 1000 years of labor.Sshe was sent to the Eradues Maxur, —who administer the protectorate frontier— who sent her to the Tret Maxur which runs the labor camps. The Tret Maxur, in turn sent her to camp Ishino north, on the gas giant Onjer Deresta —which she only knew as Karputha. It was there, above a place called the diamond sea, that Prix labored on what had been named, the Karpidan Shield. The shield was made up of thousands of trillions of identical clear panels, each one a square meter with scalloped corners. When she was told to, Prix would stack the panels, and then she would be told to move the panels, or would be sent out to lay them above the Karputha sky.

Above the diamond sea, she lost herself to sorrow, and then anger, and then lost the memories themselves. Her species brain's were not evolved to store and process hundreds of years of life, and even though the Tret Maxur would regularly rejuvenate her biological body, it did nothing for her mind. When she was released, she had no idea who she was, .


Like many reformaents, she had no one to claim her after the one thousand year sentence of labor, and was a lost soul.

If she had not pledged to the legionatus before her crime, she would have wound up a trooper anyways. As it was, when she had begun her rehabilitation after her release the Tret Maxur where she had served her sentence, she was informed that the legionatus was awaiting her to report and fullfill the 100 year pledge she made before her transgressions.
