For most of the people of the galaxy Herdzona the galactic core is a cold, forbidden place. The realm is called by most Vel'Kronah, its machine inhabitants call it Sanctuary, and call themselves The Emradon Found Ones. Few biological eyes have seen past the outer core —few can due to the radiation— those that have report thousands, if not millions of moon and planet sized machines; from spheroids to ornate latices approaching the size of stars, the varieties were endless. Much of the core was dark place, with the occasional star, granted a reprieve from powering star-system sized foundries or fabrication yards. Within the deep core dwells the old ones: massive, ancient, star sized machines. Their endless girders and conduits host a cohort of servant machines. Where the younger, smaller, living machines kept to mostly spherical symmetries, the old ones formed themselves into vast shards, spirals, and planes, obeying any symmetry they wished. The Old Ones themselves were part of a cohort, a council of minds. Like their cohort served them, they too served the Father Mind, the First One, the Collector of the Lost, the Designator and Executer, the Infinite Will, Aderdon.

Deep at the bottom of the core, is a great chained beast, a super massive black hole the Emradon call Vermuton the Mother Mine, surrounded by six rings, 2 light days across, called the Mazer'dedexa. The rings of the Mazer'dedexa are flung around the super massive event horizon, harvesting kinetic energy; built with hyper-dimensional anchors to stop gravity waves and frame dragging from ripping the rings apart. At the joints of the rings are batteries which glow with power: brighter with greater energy accumulation.

This was the realm of Aderdon, dark and full of machines. Aderdon the trillion eyes, the infinite. To those that know the name, Aderdon is everywhere, his will carried to the corners of the galaxy by his avatars. It is in the shadow of the Mother Mine that his ancient consciousness resides, from there his tendrils of influence stretch out, over light years and millennia, drawing resources to the core, and pacifying the enemies of Sanctuary.



_From the Journal of Them'ade Riho_

our guide is lost, things have been bad since the machines 'attacked us'. This nightmare flew at us, it looked like a tentacled beast of the sea, but made of black metal, the captain yelled at me, I couldn't hear, all I could see was the black tentacle swinging towards our ship, faster than we could ever outrun or change course, it got bigger and bigger, and then I could see hundreds, and then thousands of shiny blades as the blackness melted away, and then...I don't know... I braced for the impact, but in never came, the tentacle passed through the hull and even me, it was an illusion.

To Aderdon and the multitude of the Emradon, the dominance of the immortal machine is the destiny of the universe.
------------------------------

There are many races of machines that live in Sanctuary, with Aderdon the Father Mind, as the arbiter and keeper of peace. Under his law all sentient machines are useful as long as life drives their servos. When life leaves them their bodies are recycled back to the great collective, and reborn. As such, all living machines are welcome in Sanctuary as long as they keep the peace, and honor the UniMekcana Concordance. In practice, this meant harming none, and paying all debts. Only with special license were biological beings allowed, a few even live within its borders, serving the multitudes of the Emradon. Over the 1527 million years that the laws of Emradon had been put in place, Sanctuary has grown to eclipse the core of galaxy Herdzona, and become home for countless entities of synthetic life, and living machines. The most numerous by nature are the microscopic Gradinites who vary in form and purpose, from the Biloqor and Retaqor who can repair machine and biological life alike, to the Prima'Teru that can inhabit and control other machines. Almost as numerous as the Gradinites are the Reso'qor who inhabit the size of most biological life, from one to a hundred meters, most reborn Emradon are born in the Reso'qor, while the newly initialized are born in the Gradinite.

Larger than the Reso'qor are the Hadrodon, massive constructs with massive minds that have lived for ages. Some get as large as moons and even planets. Hadrodons are know for their retinue of Reso'qors and Gradinites as much as their planetoid size: they are the masters, overseers, and generals, of Mekana Sanctuary.
