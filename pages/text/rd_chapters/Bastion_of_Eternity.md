Under the Drudien sea, heavy war platform Warrior's Heart flew, traversing hundreds of meters per second. Its repelling fields drove all debris and particles out of its path. Anything solid within 10 miles was swept away in an etheral current. The sea creatures of the Aerielisk ocean had never experienced anything like it, a round city sized ship, driving them away from its path, and leaving them with a ringing boom moments after. The builders of the war platform had not made one aerodynamical consideration to its shape, for within the repelling fields several kinds of kinetic compensation fields were at work: the net effect being, while the Warrior's Heart sailed under the Drudien Sea, a power-armored heavy guard could patrol its outer decks; the current slowed around them as if it were a stormy breeze. Commanding those patrolling guards was ved'commander Brak Kor'socha.

Brak preferred to be on the live-deck, as the outer hull of the war platform was known, during deployments. It was not always so, once he would have called it overkill, a waste of resources, unnecessary. The infantry was glorious (come victory or defeat), not wasteful. Brak suspected a few of his subordinates felt the same, but like him when he was younger, they don't complain, they just follow their orders with courage and vigilance. Now the seasoned war commander knew better, he knew that, while the Warrior's Heart was at speed, nothing on this planet could touch them; but one in a million hells could await them when they stopped, and no price is too high that can buy time when flying into a tough fight. Brak had learned the near fatal lesson, the best time to meet the moment, is right when it happens. He was at his preferred station, right behind the number two lead pylon. He worked at a console set into the bulkhead, here he was shielded from most of the current in a purpose built station complete with safety railing encircling the area for securing lines and lanyards. From here, through the console and his embedded com-matrix interface, he observed and commanded four squads of ten armored infantry â€”enough to turn a city embers and slag. The Bastion of Eternity was no normal city. It had done much to earn the distinction of 'eternal', it had stood to longer than most of the soldiers on patrol, not Brak, he'd been a young trooper when this space was still part of the Hyperg'enot, but to keep this palce a secret, that was a feat that few could have achieved. He'd been to far to know of this space, which was locally known as Dia'sosa, to the Hyperg'enot as Rehmaria, and to the Segetum Hodonus as sector Resiat'us 314-B29-462, or Resiat'us Ulu. It had reputation that most empty space had: not a place to go without a plan and reason, unless you planned to die there. Radiation alone forbade ninety eight percent of land borne from ever sailing the stars; failure to have adequate life support was the next most prolific killer. Anything that could carve out such a territory was something to wary of.

The top commanders believed resistance would be fierce, but quickly overwhelmed. It was believed they had undersea assets, the Warrior's Heart was to strike at any surrounding the island, and establish a beach head on southern shore of the island, which was overlooked by the Bastion of Eternity.

The protectorate loathes a slaughter, but if one must happen, they direct it be quick and one sided. And so the Warrior's Heart slowed as it came upon the southern shallows of the island, loosing hypersonic torpedos at the submerged Estamre warships and the Srill underwater base anchored beyond the island fortress. Heavy gunships launched from opening hanger doors on the inside of the pylons, and closed on the submerged and floating Council warships. As the Warrrior's Heart breached the surface, and rose above the waves, massive detonations turned the sea around the island white; hundreds of fountains sprayed upward, sometimes with oil, debris and bodies, each spray the death knell of a doomed Council warship. During that time Brak was busy giving orders, the four squads had been relieved of screen patrol and they began deployed into the field of battle, quickly destroying the small guard posts on the beach. The Diamond Council had no warning of their attack, the beach was deserted save a few scattered guards who had never seen an ambush on these shores. The Island was very green for being in such could waters, the shore was a band of sand around the islands souther side, beyond which and evergreen forest grew up the mountains until the frost line half way up the peaks of the Urdo Mountains. Jutting from the western slopes of Urdo mountain was the Bastion of Eternity. The bastion and its walls were made of black stone, hundreds cannons and ballista studded its battlements. The Warrior's Heart was to secure the waters, beach and lower ground of the island and so they did not answer the flaming missiles from the black fortress. The war platform Titan Hand, descended from above, in a timed attack. Titan Hand flew with its forward citadels parted slightly to reveal the war platform's central siege complex. Beneath hundreds of layers of repelling shields, kinetic arrestors, and energy shunt fields, was the central cannonade. Thousands of different arms could be deployed from the central battlements
