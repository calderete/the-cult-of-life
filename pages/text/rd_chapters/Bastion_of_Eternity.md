Under the Drudien sea, heavy war platform Warrior's Heart flew, at hundreds of meters per second. Its repelling fields drove all debris and particles out of its path. Anything solid within 10 miles was swept away in an etheral current. The sea creatures of the Aerielisk ocean had never experienced anything like it, a round city sized ship, driving them away from its path, and leaving them with a ringing boom moments after. The builders of the war platform had not made one aerodynamical consideration to its shape, for within the repelling fields several kinds of kinetic compensation fields were at work: the net effect being, while the Warrior's Heart sailed under the Drudien Sea, a power-armored heavy guard could patrol its outer decks; the current slowed around them as if it were a stormy breeze. Commanding those patrolling guards was ved'commander Brak Kor'socha.

Brak preferred to be on the live-deck, as the outer hull of the war platform was known, during deployments. It was not always so, once he would have called it overkill, a waste of resources, unnecessary. The infantry was glorious (come victory or defeat), not wasteful. Brak suspected a few of his subordinates felt the same, but like him when he was younger, they don't complain, they just follow their orders with courage and vigilance. Now the seasoned war commander knew better, he knew that, while the Warrior's Heart was at speed, nothing on this planet could touch them; but one in a million hells could await them when they stopped, and no price is too high that can buy time when flying into a tough fight. Brak had learned the near fatal lesson, the best time to meet the moment, is right when it happens. He was at his preferred station, right behind the number two lead pylon. He worked at a console set into the bulkhead, here he was shielded from most of the current in a purpose built station complete with safety railing encircling the area for securing lines and lanyards. From here, through the console and his embedded com-matrix interface, he observed and commanded four squads of ten armored infantry —enough to turn a city embers and slag. The Bastion of Eternity was no normal city. It had done much to earn the distinction of 'eternal', it had stood longer than most of the soldiers on patrol, not Brak, he'd been a young trooper when this space was still part of the Hyperg'enot, but to keep this palce a secret, that was a feat that few could have achieved. He'd been to far to know of this space, which was locally known as Dia'sosa, to the Hyperg'enot as Rehmaria, and to the Segetum Hodonus as sector Resiat'us 314-B29-462, or Resiat'us Ulu. It had reputation that most empty space had: not a place to go without a plan and reason, unless you planned to die there. Radiation alone forbade ninety eight percent of land borne from ever sailing the stars; failure to have adequate life support was the next most prolific killer. Anything that could carve out such a territory was something to wary of.

The top commanders believed resistance would be fierce, but quickly overwhelmed. It was believed they had undersea assets, the Warrior's Heart was to strike at any surrounding the island, and establish a beach head on southern shore of the island, which was overlooked by the Bastion of Eternity.

The protectorate loathes a slaughter, but if one must happen, they direct it be quick and one sided. And so the Warrior's Heart slowed as it came upon the southern shallows of the island, loosing hypersonic torpedos at the submerged Estamre warships and the Srill underwater base anchored beyond the island fortress. Heavy gunships launched from opening hanger doors on the inside of the pylons, and closed on the submerged and floating Council warships. As the Warrrior's Heart breached the surface, and rose above the waves, massive detonations turned the sea around the island white; hundreds of fountains sprayed upward, sometimes with oil, debris and bodies, each spray the death knell of a doomed Council warship. During that time Brak was busy giving orders, the four squads had been relieved of screen patrol and they began deployed into the field of battle, quickly destroying the small guard posts on the beach. The Diamond Council had no warning of their attack, the beach was deserted save a few scattered guards who had never seen an ambush on these shores. The Island was very green for being in such cold waters, the shore was a band of sand around the islands souther side, beyond which and evergreen forest grew up the mountains until the frost line half way up the peaks of the Urdo Mountains. Jutting from the western slopes of Urdo mountain was the Bastion of Eternity. The bastion and its walls were made of black stone, hundreds cannons and ballista studded its battlements. The Warrior's Heart was to secure the waters, beach and lower ground of the island and so they did not answer the flaming missiles from the black fortress. The war platform Titan Hand, descended from above, in a timed attack. Titan Hand flew with its forward citadels parted slightly to reveal the war platform's central siege complex. Beneath hundreds of layers of repelling shields, kinetic arrestors, and energy shunt fields, was the central cannonade. Thousands of different arms could be deployed from the central battlements. A gapping hole with a spinning ball of fire and lighting signaled the proto-plasma cannon was the one firing.

The Dra'sul channel runs down the middle of Thesingratt Island (Thesingratt Isle) splitting the civilian side, from the Diamond Council side. The civilian city Vert'if dominates the land on the eastern side of Thesingratt, while the western side is mostly virgin forest controlled by the council, and the tall Urdo Mountains. The black battlements of the Bastion of Eternity could be seen from the Dra'sul channel. Long ago the Urdo mountains were much larger, but the eastern side had been reduced to flat plains by the Heldraetch Magi of the Diamond Hold(the Diamond Hold is what the council calls the alliance of armies in the Diamond Council). On the eastern side of the Dra'sul channel was the clear plain, a mile of short grass which was forbidden to any traversal. A mile west of the channel the Clear Plain ends into the dark woods of the Suntha'wot Forest. The ancient forest climbed the western flanks of the Urdo Mountains, covering the scars inflicted by the Heldraetch Magi. The Suntha'wot red and black woods, went halfway up the Urdo. A line of grey marked the highest that the hearty trees could make it up the cold slopes. The tip of Urdo peak was capped with snow all year. Just below the snow line was built the Eastern Gate of the Bastion of Eternity.

The Eternal Courage appeared above the Dra'sul crossing without warning, the gate guards were engaged with angry locals, only once the civilians began to run away in fear, did sub-corporal Hug'evie, and master-sergeant Rexetus'vetru turn towards the city sized war platform hovering above them. The master-sergeant made out fast moving glints in the sky, and did not hesitate, "INCOMING!". As they had drilled for rear attack, the two crossing guards raised an armored barricade and dove for the covered side of it. The glints were black matter shurikens, aimed at the bridge. Each shuriken struck deep into the brick of the bridge before the destablished singularity exploded, the shuriken blades becoming sharpnel flying near the speed of light vaporizing the ancient bricks. A line of mushroom clouds rose above the obliterated bridge. Mech infantry squad Dresta-24 descended on the check point. The master-sergeant had recieved orders to fire back at the invaders, he hesitated as the 6 mech infantry landed with loud thuds, his discipline quickly returned, "Keep in cover and open fire!!" he order to the sub-corporal. From behind the thick steel barricade they opened up with there carbines on the closest intruder. The brass rounds bounced harmlessly off the angled armor of the mech-infantry, and only served to indentify themselves as hostile elements. One of the mech-infantry fired their thrusters, moving obliquely, gaining altitude as their shoulder mounted kinetic cannon aimed down on the guards behind their barricade. No longer covered, master-sergeant Rexestus'vetru gave his last order, "RUN!!" By their second desperate stride, hyper-kinectic rounds super-heated to plasma by atmospheric friction, struck their bodies, the bursting viscera enveloped by flying dust and rock as the hyper rounds buried themselves deep into the ground.

Squad Dresta-24 signaled to command that bridge crossing was secure. They had been ordered by Custodia Conquesta Uvetho to secure this area and show threat to bring out any remaining elements. The guards had been standard infantry, Uvetho had told them, there are far greater warrriors on this world than would at first appear.

More mech-infantry squads streamed from the Eternal Courage towards the black stone in the mountaines, towards the Bastion of Eternity. Each squad consisting of 6 armored modular machines, officailly know as Omni-Guard (OG) class battle suits. Every inch of outer surface of an Omni-Gaurd class suit was diamond hard —including weapons. Each OG suite could walked on two thick legs, which could transform into four if required. Eight arms —most ending in various gun and launcher barrels branched from armored servos on the back.

--------------------------

Within the halls and barracks of the bastion of eternity, chaos and panic ensued, Lord General Harok'to ordered the bastion locked down, and the Golems to munster. The sight of the towering golems marching to the high battlements brought some calm to the panicing soldeirs and guardsmen. The ground trembled under their long armored legs. From the council overlook, (which has not been used in battle since the last time this island had been invaded centuries ago), Harok'to scanned the horizon, he could see mostly clouds, the seers told him something big was out there, dropping giant mechanical soldiers. Reports where that the bridge had been annihilated, and the city gaurds had not responded to communication for the last ten minutes.

people say might doesn't mean right, sometimes you need to be both, or it will never matter who was right


Victory or defeat the Draven Infantry is courageous
Victory or defeat the Draven Infantry is glorious
All hez'infantry are warriors of Provota

A warrior is a servant
A warrior is a defender
A warrior must meet the moment

In the fashion of the Exeka'Protectoratium the Proto-plasma cannon was given an understated name. A naked singularity is placed at the center of a storm of competing forces. A ball of explosive reality is formed under gigantic counter forces, and is sent along a powerful gravimetric rail beam. It is a terrifying siege weapon.
