It was dark, and fear gripped Prix. She lay on something cold and hard, her eyes gradually focused on shimering lights, orbiting each other, making a vague circle in her vision. The smell of smoke filled her nostrils, she could tell there was fire nearby, invoking chilhood memories of camping, and family, and safety, feelings which evaporated quickly as her eyes focused more. Her limbs felt as if she was awaking from a restful sleep, she was able to bend her waist, and raise her head and body with much effort. She was in a house sized circular room, a fire and two cages made three points of a triangle centered within room. The fire was the only source of light illuminating the room, the two cages and their occupants. The walls were featurless and black in the amber light of the fire. Drums sounded far in the distance sending diffuse, humming, vibrations through the floor and bars of her cage. The walls rose around her and curved to come together at the spinning lights which were fan blades, the edges of the wall creating a hole for the fan to spin in. In the other cage she could see a lump of clothing that she assumed was another captive like herself.
