From the official journal of Hum'rego Yath 24.345.687.230 (<< temp) from the discovery mission of Vovol system, planet Sera, galaxy Broch'ara, Sector Re'gostra 1132.

In observatory orbit of Re'gostra (EM-66KA-FFG3-CWHY-9EW8-Re'gostra-1132), begun first phase of evaluation. The life survey is half complete. Have scouted ten initial locations for extended observation drones.

-------------------

Hum'rego never imagined he would find himself, this far from home. Starlight seemed different here to him, slightly orange and brown he thought, and overall darker, like it was all oily and slick from passing through something vile. No, this was much farther than he would have ever liked to get from home. But he had asked for this. He considered it a privledge to be the one to catalog a distant planet, which had only been surveyed with long range scopes. It had been designated EM-66KA-FFG3-CWHY-9EW8-Re'gostra-1132. Hum'rego had redisignated it (for the duration of his investigation), Re'gostra; giving it the name of its sector.

It was a jewel of a world, large with white ice caps at the poles, and verdant green covering all the land at the tropics. Reports were that a single race dominated this world (usually a sign of a brutal species) that appeared to live in natural harmony. The race had only been given a designation (Hum'rego would report what they wished to be named) and had been tentativally classed as a primal, non-ascending species. His superiors did not give him an interesting subject for his first assignment. The inhabitants of this world made barely enough light to be seen from orbit at night, and likely lived subsestance lifestyles. It was expected that he would catalog the people of Re'gostra as one of trillions of non-ascending species that would forever be confined to their world, doomed to its eventual fate.

However uninteresting the inhabitants of Re'gostra turned out to be Hum'rego would observe and investigate this world, following all the rules of the Archen, the Strada Imprexta, and the Hurusto Concladia: when he was done, he will write out the whole history of these people into presistance, into the great archives of the Accadia Stor'Datu: they will ensure the story of their people is preserved, if not the flesh and blood itself.

This planet had only three continents, one dominant large landmass, which stretched nearly pole to pole, over almost half the planet's surface. Two other small continents, one in the vast ocean covering half the planet, and another smaller one which was seperated by the main continent by a narrow channel on its easter shores. His observation would begin with the main continent (with 10 settlements), which was as a logistical decision owing to his small ship and limited resources. Once he had a profile of the societies on the main continent, and then would investigate the lone landmasses.

Life survey is complete, drones are in place and sending data. My initial profile of Niven society is unlike any I've studied or heard of. They are a society centered around families, with vast clans which form the structure of their society. They are a low technology people, that appear to strive for a balance in living. They live mostly in village like communities, all I have surveyed have at least three prominent families in them. There are some settlements which could be considered "cities" none larger than ten thousand inhabitents. Life survey reports the total number of Niven on this planet to be 3.4 billion. Niven from different regions have diffiring styles, and some cultural differences, they all share a common core culture. As far as I can tell, they have no concept of sovereign states, and have no borders. My intial question I wish to answer about the Niven is, how have they maintained peace? I suspect it may have something to do with their low-tech life style. I have recorded the below specialties and roles in Niven culture.

Farmer: Works the farms which feed the local village
Gardener: Assists with maintaining personal gardens
Builder: Builds structures, out of stone and harvested wood and grasses
Nanny: Assists with raising/teaching children
Chief: Leads the village with the village council
Counselor: Member of the village council
Public Counselor: Aide to counselors, and also aids the village public with legal matters
Artist: Dedictated to creating art, spends long times in the forest.
Craft Maker: Specialized in one or more crafts, from furniture maker to stone carvers.
Arbiter: Settles disputes among the villagers
Priest: Performs burial rights

The Niven practice a form of nature relegion, each settlement has a high priest, with several apprentices (depending on the settlement size) who's primary duty is to perform burial rights, and give console to any who visit their huts. They do not hold any sort of mass. I have observed some hight preists give speeches to gathered residents. The speech appeared to be about maintiaining balance and caring for the future. Translation matrices are half complete.

-------------------

The Niven revered their forests, Hum'rego could tell that much. He spent every waking hour in the primary observatorium lab: reviewing footage and data from his ten drones floating above the Niven who were going about their life. They also seemed to revere nature and their world. He could only guess until the translation processors finished building a matrix, which would allow him to understand the Niven. It seemed the very fabric of their culture revolved around nature. Every home was surrounded with trees and green, still the Niven kept dozens of plants inside their wood and brick dwelings. An artist he had been tracking, was even in the process of sculpting a grand, life-size, 30ft tall tree in their studio.

Hum'rego had deduced the artists surname was Al'tro, who lived in a coastal settlement. The artist would travel to forest, to harvest bark from trees, praying at each one before removing several small pieces of bark. Back at his studio, he would gaze at the bark, and replicate the patterns of all his gathered pieces into the clay of his tree sculpture. Hum'rego assumed this piece would be laquered like the others in Al'tro's studio; in brilliant reds, yellows, and greens.
