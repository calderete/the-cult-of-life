In observatory orbit of Sera, begun first phase of evaluation. The life survey is half complete. Have scouted ten initial locations for extended observation drones.

-------------------

Hum'rego never imagined he would find himself, this far from home. Starlight seemed different here to him, slightly orange and brown he thought, and overall darker, like it was all oily and slick from passing through something vile. No, this was much farther than he would have ever liked to get from home. But he had asked for this. He considered it a privledge to be the one to catalog a distant planet, which had only been surveyed with long range scopes. It had been designated EM-66KA-FFG3-CWHY-9EW8-Re'gostra-1132. Hum'rego had redisignated it (for the duration of his investigation), Re'gostra-1132; giving it the name of its sector.

Life survey is complete, drones are in place and sending data. My initial profile of Niven society is unlike any I've studied or heard of. They are a society centered around families, with vast clans which form the structure of their society. The are a low technology people, that appear to strive for a balance in living. They live mostly in village like communities, all I have surveyed have at least three prominent families in them. There are some settlements which could be considered "cities" none larger than ten thousand inhabitents. Life survey reports the total number of Niven on this planet to be 3.4 billion. Niven from different regions have diffiring styles, and some cultural differences, they all share a common core culture. As far as I can tell, they have no concept of sovereign states, and have no borders. My intial question I wish to answer about the Niven is, how have they maintained peace? I suspect it may have something to do with their low-tech life style. I have recorded the below specialties and roles in Niven culture.

Farmer: Works the farms which feed the local village
Gardener: Assists with maintaining personal gardens
Builder: Builds structures, out of stone and harvested wood and grasses
Nanny: Assists with raising/teaching children
Chief: Leads the village with the village council
Counselor: Member of the village council
Public Counselor: Aide to counselors, and also aids the village public with legal matters
Artist: Dedictated to creating art, spends long times in the forest.
Craft Maker: Craft makers specialize in one or more crafts, from furniture maker to stone carvers.
