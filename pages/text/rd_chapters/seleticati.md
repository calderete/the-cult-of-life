From his observation deck on the _Soul Oculus_, orbiting a green jungle planet, the recruiter —seleticati— arga-class Hum'rego Yath watched a scene unfold below him with interest. He had been told their were fighters that might interest him on this world, and so he took the Soul Oculus into the wilderness; past the frontier, and into the Errapa to see what this planet —called Hedyat— had in store for his eyes and ears. On his observatory display was a scene of chaos and blood. A battle between rival clans on this jungle world that had been raging for weeks. The clan Ji'tro was badly outnumbered, and yet their battle against the larger Hik'xi looked to be a roiling stale-mate. The Ji'tro struck quickly and fiercely, using terrain at all engagements, and opting for a quick retreat so that they could live to bleed their larger foe even more. It was a good tactic, thought Hum'rego. A stratagem as old as tyrants with empires, he had seen it many times his in 245 thousand years of service to the protectorate. It was in these places that one found heros worthy of protectorate.

The Ji'tro warlord was cunning and brutal, but Hum'rego was more intrigued by the one who carried out the Ji'tro attack plans. Hum'rego's eyes and ears are made for his profession, when close to a person he knows empathically what a living thing feels. And from afar, he can see clearly those that are the real heros in a fight, and those that are not. In this battle it was one called Drem'tun. Using the unimpeded vision of the Soul Oculus, Hum'rego watched Drem'tun.

----------

Drem'tun wanted the Hik'xi to pay, he wanted them to feel terror. For four hundred years the Hik'xi had claimed his ancestral mountains as theirs to rule, the Ji'tro had even let them —for a time. But now, his warriors delivered the pain and fear promised by his forefathers —which had been given in curses against betrayers. His family —the cur'dragons— planned long for this glorious day. A plan Drem'tun learned of as a young boy, when his parents made him memorize its every detail. As a prince of the Ji'tro, he was not likely to be kidnapped, nonetheless, like everyone else, he memorized the plans in code —in an ancient sing-song language of his people; thus keeping to one of the most important parts of the generational strategy: "The Hik'xi must never suspect". The Hik'xi never suspected, and sent their armies into the traps laid for them, and now Drem'tun himself was to spring one of the finale schemes.

In his treehut, Drem'tun prepared himself, and reflected on everything sacrificed so that his people could once again live free. His warriors had waged a guerrilla war on the Hik'xi, in response they moved deeper into Ji'tro territory, to a place where they could deploy screens and the land was flatter. The place was known to the Ji'tro as the slateland, the Hik'xi thought themselves safer there, but it was Drem'tun's ancestors that had decreed the Hik'xi find themselves in the slateland. It seemed the that still, the Hik'xi suspected nothing, and knew nothing of what had been done to the ground of the slateland.

As the hour approached, the captains of Drem'tun visited his treehut, the first was his first captain, and brother in-law Fen'tak, there to deliver a status report.

"Our warriors are ready to ride" the first captain said.

"Does Ton'rot remain?" Asked Drem'tun, referring to the Hik'xi general.

"He's dug himself in fast brother, they have the slatelands defended well" The sarcasm behind his words causes a smirk to cross the first captain's face, drawing the prince's ire. Drem'tun turned to Fen'tak and half growled.

"Beware your thoughts, no battle-plan is ordained to succeed"

"Your pardon my prince. But if I may? Everything has gone as the priests, and the olds ones foretold. So far every scheme and misdirection has worked, forgive me but, we have no reason to think the Hik'xi will not perish as foretold."

"We are not here by myth or prophecy, but sacrifice, and blood....blood knows no rules. It is all chaos Fen'tak, chaos that we ride and fight and kill. It can...it _will_ turn on us, remember that Captain"

"Yes my prince..."

There was a knock at the wooden door of his hut, the prince's guard opened the door to admit second captain Gur'kul and under-captain Rah'vet. They took up their places at the prince's planning table on the either side of Fen'tak. The second-captain

On the Soul Oculus Humrego watched, and waited for the moment. He took in every detail he could about Drem'tun, he would need every scrap of knowledge about him if he was to convince him to leave with him on the Soul Oculus. Segado Loro —assistant to Humrego— did not believe the prince would be leaving with them, he gave voice to his thoughts. "This one has such focus. He'll never leave"
