### The Ascendiant

On the planet once called Mo'trevix, near its barren surface, in the shadow of a crater, a searing light hovers near the barren ground. White crooked bolts of current arched to the surface, cackling, and coalescing. The bolts multiply, becoming furiously entangled, until for a single, split instant, they merged into one wide swath of lighting, casting long shadows up the crater, and sending out a thunderous thermal shock wave, which blew out across the crater. Dust is kicked out and vaporized in an expanding halo. Rock is shattered and melted; leaving behind a charred scar on the lifeless planet. At the epicenter of the blast, the ground was a molten pool, hovering above which was a sphere of darkness; encircled by halo of chaotic white light. As the shockwave reached the edge of the crater, the light and ball of blackness, dimmed and disappeared from mortal view.

It was a rebirth of a cosmically powerful entity who called itself Qur'xul. They are an ancient, twisted being, part of a race —as old as stars— which calls themselves the Xesrtix'zem'yta —a name which means nothing to Qur'xul. Like all very old powerful things, Qur'xul, and the Xesrtix'zem'yta have been called many things. Those that knew of the history of Xesrtix'zem'yta, called them tredat'ra —chaotic ascendants— a name it earns in Qur'xul's rebirth. The energy to fuel such a resurrection, was drawn from the kinect energy of the entire plant, and now, the spin and orbit of Mo'trevix, have been halted. Earth quakes rippling out from the core would reach the surface in hours, already surface tremors cause the dusty ground everywhere to begin to shift and settle. And so Qur'xul lives up to the tredat'ra namesake, as a truly chaotic ascendant.

Qur'xul's vanishing was a self defense maneuver. They had yet to regain full memory, perception, and sense of self, and were vulnerable in this dazed and confused state. Within minutes of their rebirth, memories flowed and processed within the vast consciousness of Qur'xul, and they remembered who had banished them to this dead space. Proof that nothing lasts forever. For hundreds of thousands of years, they was a she, and she was a great, fell queen of many worlds, who was called Vetexu —the 'Conqueress'—. Her subjects turned on her. embarking on a multi generational plot —which was miraculously kept the secret from their queen until the plan was near completion— spanning her vast kingdom, aimed at killing their tyrant god queen.

As Qur'xul regained their memories and mind, they began to build, both in normal and extra dimensions, a construct that they would inhabit which they called the dedatrum. The dedatrum was a place where the vast mind of the chaotic ascendant could manifests itself. In the dedatrum —and only in the dedatrum— Qur'xul bursts into view —a black orb coated in light— and they decided that the construct will be cube-like, but also a maze, and they would be a he.
