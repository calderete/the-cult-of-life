From the moment Sar'tego had been given his current assignment, it had felt wrong. Everything about anomaly 45BD-11238371 seemed wrong to those that knew of it. In the one thousand years that sector 11238371 had been under protectorate rule the space around anomaly 45BD (as it was referred to locally) had been an oddity, a strange pocket of nothing. The area had changed hands many times, and when an enterprising savant compared old star charts of the area, they found records of whole star systems —five of them— that were supposed to be where the strange emptiness now was. The savant applied for, and received permission to begin an investigation, and anomaly 45BD-11238371 was officially designated, and the investigation begun.

At first, the investigation was pursued by the researchers of Segetum Accadaria. The disappearance of star systems was deemed a natural anomaly. The savants of the Accadaria believed the missing systems had been disrupted; the planets thrown away by a large star or black hole, to begin life as rouges. It was believed a detailed survey would alight the final locations of the missing planets and stars, and perhaps reveal the culprit of the disturbance. There were detractors among the savants of this theory. The space was once ruled by the Hyperg'enot, a vast and powerful empire, it was argued 45BD may be a leftover weapon or trap, and the Segetum Victron should take over the investigation. The detractors of the flung-system theory were in the minority, but it was agreed that any survey should be escorted.

The Accadaria applied for escort to the Victron, who in turn charged the Eradeus Maxur with protecting the investigation of 45BD. The Eradeus Maxur concluded the remote location was an ideal theater of operation for the Legionatus exa'legionate, who's fast ships can deploy quickly, and navigate star systems with ease. Under orders, the Legionatus dispatched two exa'legionate heavy cruisers to rendezvous with the investigation of 45BD. The Accadaria themselves assembled a team of experienced surveyors and set course for 45BD with an escort large enough to hold an entire world at bay. Once inside what would become known as the anomaly zone, communication with the expedition was lost, and they were never heard from again. The Accadaria and Legionatus ships were tracked into the center of the zone, were the ship's transponders ceased transmitting.

The Protectorate executers responded by deploying Legionatus Heavy Strike Guard regiments around the anomaly zone. After establishing a perimeter the encircling force sent in a battalion, who encountered Qur'Xul. Only 200 of the 1300 strong Heavy Strike battalion returned. They reported encountering a powerful ascendant entity, with seemingly limitless power. Most of the battalion sacrificed themselves, so that a few might escape. The 200 survivors carried with them the information of what cut off ship's communications, and blanketed 3 star systems in darkness. The savants they had been escorting stayed behind, so they could gather and relay as much information as they could, before dying or self destructing to avoid capture; they achieved their objective —much information was gathered.

Most importantly they discovered a powerful gravimetric field that cut off most forms of communication, and hid the space from most forms of observation. The source of the field was an outer planer of an uninhabited system. It was designated a high priority target, a sri'elite Ban Vara was dispatched to destroy whatever was generating the field. Of almost of as much importance was discovery of a sole life-bearing planet which was known locally as Ver'mel. To the verdant and stormy world a sur'elite envoy-operator was dispatched to gain first hand knowledge of life on the world.

The envoy had returned, and was now informing Sar'tego of their findings. The envoy's name was Repma'hof, if not for her file Sar'tego would not have known that they were a she, of a bi-pedal star lineage that he had never heard of: called the Benserata. Like all beings that find themselves in the ranks of void soldiers, the envoy's skin was a dark. Her's was deep (almost black) purple with faint grey dots. She had a full head of hair —something Sar'tego rarely saw— bright orange in color. Even though they did not share a language, Repma'hof had no issue conveying her confidence and aptitude through the translation matrix. Sar'tego heard her voice as clear, and even —like most void soldiers. "I've not seen anything like this, even in the Infinite Palace. This world, Ver'mel, is ruled by a class 12-4 Astrata'ascendant being name Qur'Xul. From my estimates, it has been this way for at least 20,000 years." An impossible amount of time given its location. "How did they maintain, this empire under Hyperg'enot rule?" Repma'hof placed her data pad down and the image of a blue green world projected into the air next to them. Outlines of all colors traced out to mark borders, and as she spoke, the names of the nations of this world became visible. "I do not know, the 12 major nations are all adversarial, and jealous. Their 'Queen' plays them, for her pleasure." Sar'tego had never encountered anything like that either —even in the Infinite Palace.
"For her pleasure?"
"I've not been able to discern any other motive."
"What would have been her motive to slaughter troopers and guards?"
"Purely territorial"
Sar'tego weighed his options, filtering his decisions through the rubrics of logical and ethical conduct, as was his honor as Directa'executor of Fleet Venaron Exava. "What do you think the populace would do, if I were to remove this rouge entity?"
