Trooper Botha 9 marched with her squad —designated Hetra 12. A long shadow from the mag-bolter on her back played like a wild metronome across their ranks. Her 30 years of life had already shown her how to fight, how to survive, and now the legionate had taught her to be a soldier-cosmicae. Vengeance was what she hunted; her prey was nothing less than a god. But she had learned, —as a daughter, as a prisoner, as a soldier— no fight is un-winnable, no thing is un-killable. Her Legionatus mentors had told her that, "hate is poison on the mind", and that the target of her hate, Qur'Xul —The Silver Queen— was a chaotic ascendant and could only be found when they wanted to be. Even if found —a rarity she had been told— only the most powerful of the Custodia-Cosma can face an ascendant and hope to survive. "Then I will become a Custodia-Cosma" she had replied. Her long journey began with the legionate.
