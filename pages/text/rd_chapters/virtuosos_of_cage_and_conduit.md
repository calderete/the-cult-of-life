From the northern jungles of Ver'mel a white hot rod of light burst from an unnatural cloud and past the blue sky. A herald for the birth of an age for the people of that jungle planet —the Vanda. Within the growing cloud the Vanda engineers watched for weeks as a blue and purple giant —who called himself Uxur Rodex— constructed miracle after miracle, until the final product —a reality forge— was produced. Uxur had brought an army of drones and dozens of fabrication plants which he used to first build a construction site, and the the final forge itself.

It was a composed orchestra of materials and machines, all arranged into a wheel with the blinding exhaust ray as its axel. The wheels spokes were made of lines of floating ore carriers which extended in every direction. From far off mountains and quarries Uxur commanded harvester drones to bring materials to the forge construction site; where they were fed into what Uxur called "the intake-array". Once dumped into the intake-array the ore is drawn down into the ore conduits; and is fed on waves of gravity into the primary smelters. From those first smelters raw metal plate and ingot rode on unseen channels into forge-fabricators that the builder referred to as "axonate-forges"; Uxur described them as, "...a fabrication facility for small and large construction materials. It can make plates, panels, beams, hulls, enclosures, logi and calcu-circuits, also power and data conduits".
