The Ban Vara: the Ordotos Veteum Protima(Segetum Custodia-Galatium), Knight-Guardians of the endless void —the sword of the protectorate.

The Ban Vara float among the stars. They meditate and sleep. Their relicor —an artificial consciousness implanted in their minds— an ever-present companion. In the galaxy called Gemi'holon, in one its spiral tips, in the sector Emhetra the Custodia-Galatium at-arms, oxa'acolyte ban vara Neta Domiata was awoken by her relicor, Er'dateus.
"Neta are you lucid? We are called. The protectorate cosmic guard battles a powerful enemy, colloquially known as the Vhm."
As the relicor spoke, Neta opened her eyes, "Thank you Er'dateus, I am awake and ready for briefing". Her black and reflective silver eyes dilated and constricted as her vision focused. The neural interface in her suit began showing her information in the sides of her vision. Er'dateus's fluid voice filled Neta's mind; it had always reminded the ban vara of her sister's.

"The Vhm are an unpleasant species, their origins and exact motivations are unknown. We do know that they are cycle swarmers, and they are swarming in protectorate border space. How they were able to get close enough to breach the frontier, is not known at this time..."
The ritual briefing was designed to help the ban vara recall their knowledge, and as the relicor spoke, Neta remembered her simulated battles with the Vhm. They were extremely hostile and could overrun planets in minutes. They were invisible until they interacted with normal space and could teleport anywhere their overseers flew. As the briefing continued images of Vhm warriors cycled through her vision. When rendered visible, they are many limbed insectoid like creatures covered in colorless reflective diamond hard plate. Most of their limbs ended in long blade-claws.

"A strategical intelligence error led to the deployment of exa'legionate troopers to defend the border colonies, several were overrun before the cosmic guard could reinforce the legionatus. Even now all the guard can do is slow the Vhm down while citizens are evacuated..." Neta's ship, which had slept while she had, was now waking up. The hum of its grav reactors grew as they began feeding more power to warming up systems. The ban vara slept in their pilot seat, and as the nav coordinates for her mission were confirmed in her briefing, Neta began working her console with one hand —powering up engines and systems— and calculating information in her nav system with the other.

"Protectorate strategic command has called for a total defensive response to halt the swarm, and reclaim vassal space. The Custodia-Galatium are sending one column of ban vara to each planet. They are calling this operation _Hevra Sword and Shield_, this sortie will be the largest you've ever been a part of..." Indeed, only in simulations had Neta been part of such a large operation. She had been on mostly solo missions, only rarely being part of a team of ban vara with a seasoned commander, but this was a dire situation. Her visual interface told her billions had already died in a dozen systems: the Vhm were only getting started, trillions more would die if they were not stopped. Over the aeons, the murderous swarm have evolved a strategy to squash all resistance; part of which was to take large swaths of galaxies —entire sectors— at once, crippling any large empires and eradicating the rest. If unchecked, they would occupy and destroy all life in an entire sector in mere months.

"We are ready for sub-novum translation, we are to use the prima channels for instant deployment. We will be under the command of column commander Get'tra Lume" Neta made some final checks and confirmed the ship was primed for travel, a soft light from the translation field bathed her ship, all systems were at full power, she would barely have time to set her loadout before making planet fall. The relicor's briefing was over, it was now time for Neta to act. Engaging a jump was a manual process by design, one by one, Neta went through a checklist as she toggled switches in the cockpit of _Star Piercer_. It began to move, pointing to its destination.

"Thank you Er'dateus, do you have recommendations for armaments?"
"Yes Neta, sachra class primitive weaponry is the most effective against the Vhm"

Neta completed the pre translation sequence _Star Piercer_ was ready to take her to where she was called. She engaged the translation drive, the engines whined and for an instant nothing happened. Then space folded around her ship in a cylinder, in front of her only blackness while stars coalesced and flowed at the edges of the void which her ship dove into. A split instant after space curled around them, it uncurled, and the stars flowed away and collapsed on each other, and the dark void melted and gave way to a field of stars above a blue-green planet —named by its inhabitants Tref'leo, its surface crisscrossed with the fires of war.

Lighting against the blackness above the skies of Tref'leo, more protectorate ships translated into the orbit of the war torn world. Her orders flowed into her neuro-com from local command, she was to be part of the ground war. In a higher, slower orbit a fierce void battle was playing out. Her ban vara brothers and sisters battled alongside the legionatus, the cosmic guard, and the proto-fleet void assault core. It was they who would ultimately defeat the Vhm incursion. Neta was to help hold them in place and 'present threat to the Vhm overseers' while the Plago Hedra put in place planetary defenses. It would be the first time she had been part of such a stratagem, which the savants-of-war had named the Negualis Full Drop and Full Hold.

Her orders were updated with targets. She spoke to her relicor, who had downloaded all of mission data.
"How do we to find the overseers?"
"In a half a setadex (~8 minutes) bombardment wings etcha 23 through 30 will deploy sub-novem wave disruptors, starting with our deployment zone, the western continent Alkais. The wave disruptors will render the Vhm visible. Strategic command believes the overseers will go to ground for the protection of the warriors once their phase ability is disabled. Our HUD is displaying a scout cruiser's sensor feed."
The HUD displayed the continent Alkais with a line roughly following its eastern shore marking the zone which the legionatus —a mostly planet bound force— and the cosmic guard held. On the other side of the line was a zone of 100 miles to the easter shore in which nothing but Vhm lived. A symbol in her HUD indicated which side was losing ground. The Vhm —for the moment— were winning. Slowly gaining square mile after square mile, and would eventually overrun the current ground forces. The relicore did not need to elaborate more, once the overseers were fully phased into the real dimension they would be visible and Neta could hunt them. They would be guarded, and overseers will retreat if they sense enough danger. She would have to move in quick, not get bogged down by warriors and guardians and kill the overseers —fairly formidable warriors themselves.

Her ship had arrived at her launch point, she killed its forward motion —stopping its orbit— and used its phase thrusters to hover above the launch point.
"Perhaps we will catch them off guard" Neta wondered aloud
"That is a possibility"

Prix moved fast among the wounded, not yet processing the death of Shemeshe. They had shared their bunks for a few nights per week for all of this waking cycle (5 weeks). Prix was on the rotation for evac-landing. The smoke filled zone was considered hot, and the support trooper carried her long range plasma rifle. She had needed to reload it several times that day so far. The planet was hell as far as she could tell, and she didn't think she would live long. They were being attacked by something invisible, and nearly indestructible. She had been outfitted with a Xyro'Exetus-Arms HX-48 long barrel rifle system, with  remote tunneling scopes, and a breach capable of firing 75.ca Spindro-plasma rounds: rounds that could peirce reflective diamond armor —the only class of muntions that had been effective against their invisible enemies.
