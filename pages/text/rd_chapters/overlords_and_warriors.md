### Overlords and Warriors

Neta flew above the Vhm, machine gun roaring. Ahead of her was an overlord, between them was 2 miles of Vhm swarm, uncovered by the sub-novem fracture grenades. Behind her went up the sheilds of Uru'Osta, while from their Defense towers high-energy kentic sluggers rained death on the Vhm. The overlord was retreating, Neta waited a moment to track its escape, and readied for her strike. She would engage with Vexi'shuriken, translocate to the overlord with her Sachra-class swords outstretched in each arm, and her anti-kentic-resonance field set to maximum. All that touched her —including the visible Vhm— will be hit with an ever-increasing kenito-graviton field.

Her Hyper Translator was not a teleport, rather a device similar to a Kenoton Launcher. It produced a phased waved of kentic energy which she would ride behind her shurikens, swords outstretched, obliterating anything that got too close. Among the Custodia, this attack is called Gravity Eagle, many also call it, Thunder Fall.

Along her arms, the blades of her Sachra swords glowed a dull amber, while the cutting edge relected like pure silver at chaotic angles. The swords were mounted to her forearms, she had shortened the front blades, while extending the rear ones so the tips would trail outstretched behind her. She loosed her shurikens at the fleeing overlord, and engaged her Hyper Translator to close the now 5 miles between them. Neta crashed through hundreds of Vhm that escaped her shurikens between her and the overlord, a massive, hot, shockwave followed, shattering some of the weakend Vhm near her path.

Her Hyper Translator disengaged and she arrived with a massive thunder clap just in front of the overlord, and the overlord sheilded itself from the oncoming shockwave of air. The overlord was made of tougher stuff then the ground warriors, had Neta charged into it with Gravity Eagle, she would only aid its escape, flinnging it miles away. To take it down for good, Neta had brought a Sortabine Rifle. The same weapon used to fight miles-long star dragons.

Her Vestade'Rine Arms, Sordabine Rifle fired 65.ca pulse meta-plasma rounds, and can only be fired by the most skillfull soldiers. Like the Sov'Harpoons, the Sordabine has a fuse set by the wielder, but its effectivness is limited by range. Each round is sheathed in by-product x-rays. When the round contacts, it explodes in a forward one dimensional rod of space, with power from beyond the universe. Most living things drop dead if a Sordabine round passes within a few hundred yards of them.

Her swords withdrew and the rifle materialized from arching electric-bolts into her hands. She had a perfect angle from the ground under the towering overlord. The blast from the round could do significant damage to the lithosphere of a planet, from here, her round blast would go into the sky. Her IFF confirming no friendlies were in the blast zone. Neta aimed at what would pass for "center mass" of the overlord who was turning to again flee (she had suspected it would fight, but this one did not like its chances). She pulled the trigger, a rod of white light cut through the air from the barrel to the overlord, the round exploded through its body and out the back, the rod of light turning to an elongated, amber cone. The overlord seemed to catch fire for a moment. Where the round had struck, its metal skin peelled away, glowing red and white, driven outward by extreme heat pressure melting then vaporizing the entire overlord in a nano-second of fury. A fireball shockwave washed over Netas sheilding, the ground around her cracked and turned black and molten in places. The Vhm which survived the blast turned molten white and vanished as their overlord was no longer able to hold them in this universe.

Neta stood in the center of miles of ash and dead Vhm. Brilliant explosions of white on either side of her signaled other Ban'Vara finding their marks. From her map she tracked and designated the next nearest overlord. He was 18 miles further east.
