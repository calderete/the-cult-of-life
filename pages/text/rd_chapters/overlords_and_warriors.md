### Overlords and Warriors

Neta flew above the Vhm, machine gun roaring. Ahead of her was an overlord, between them was 2 miles of Vhm swarm, uncovered by the sub-novem fracture grenades. Behind her went up the sheilds of Uru'Osta, while from their Defense towers high-energy kentic sluggers rained death on the Vhm. The overlord was retreating, Neta waited a moment to track its escape, and readied for her strike. She would engage with Vexi'shuriken, and translocate to the overlord with her Sachra-class swords outstretched in each arm, and her anti-kentic-resonance field set to maximum. All that touched her —including the visible Vhm— will be hit with an ever-increasing kenito-graviton field.

Her Hyper Translator was not a teleport, rather a device similar to a Kenoton Launcher. It produced a phased waved of kentic energy which she would ride behind her shurikens, swords outstretched, obliterating anything that got too close. Among the Custodia, this attack is called Gravity Eagle, many also call it, Thunder Fall.

Along her arms, the blades of her Sachra swords glowed a dull amber, while the cutting edge relected like pure silver at chaotic angles. The swords were mounted to her forearms, she had shortened the front blades, while extending the rear ones so the tips would trail outstretched behind her. She loosed her shurikens at the fleeing overlord, and engaged her Hyper Translator to close the now 5 miles between them. Neta crashed through hundreds of Vhm that escaped her shurikens between her and the overlord, a massive, hot, shockwave followed, shattering some of the weakend Vhm near her path.

Her Hyper Translator disengaged just in front of the overlord's path, she arrived with a massive thunder clap, and the overlord sheilded itself from the oncoming shockwave of air. The overlord was made of tougher stuff then the ground warriors, had Neta charged into it with Gravity Eagle, she would only aid its escape, flinnging it miles away. To take it down for good, Neta had brought a Sortabine Rifle. The same weapon used to fight miles-long star dragons.
