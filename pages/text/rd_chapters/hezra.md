Hezra Helrata's feet touched the grey metal surface, her decent rockets shut off and her legs took her full weight against the surface of the object. It was called Heaven's Labyrinth, it had other names too, but that is the one Helrata knew to be the most common. She had labored long for the right to stand on this mysterious artificial planet. Despite being able to walk Heaven's Labyrinth, not much was known of it. It was a metal sphere 10 million miles in diameter, it surface covered in shifting patterns groved into grey steel which had a subtle reflective sheen: and was unbroken save a single opening known as the Tangled Gate.
