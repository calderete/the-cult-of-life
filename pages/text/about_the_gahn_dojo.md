The Gahn dojo is part of the Or'sato Greda and train recruits for the _cosmic legion_ an elite fighting force that can be deployed anywhere a _herald_ places a homing a beacon.

The cosmic legion is comprised of soldiers, pilots, and void farers that are vassals of the protectorate. The Protectorate Administraetus recruits, as part of its tribute, the finest examples of fighters, engineers, doctors, artists, and craft-masters from the populations of the protectorate vassals. Recruits are granted admission to the _stregema_.

In the Gahn dojo game masters put recruits through increasingly harder ordeals of combat with every weapon imaginable. The games are routinely to the death.
