**Falling-star:** Informal for an object (usually a star) collapsing into a black hole

**undone:** Informal for something destroyed by a _Beam of fate_ or similar type weapon

**Sub-novum:** The smallest of scales/dimensions where time and distance can become blurred. For ascendant _race-lines_ it is only a realm of possibility and even construct. ("Quantum")

**Gul Suma:** Other names for Gul Suma: _The Knowing_, _Knowing_, _The All Knowing_,....and many variations which are further listed in the _Store Accadatuas+_ data vaults. Many names are translated names of mythological gods.

**Stor Accadatuas:** The _Cult of Knowledge_ maintains the massive data library known as the _Store Accadatuas_ which is charged with persisting all possible knowledge gathered by the ascendant cults. The _Store Accadatuas+_ is often referenced in citations, such as: "CA-C: Nokchta-Roko, 5-17-54-1009"

**Advhat:** The Honored Ultra Savant Serjonus Hautus Advhat Soktum (name shortened) codified into the cult of the life, the long held belief that achieving true translation, and thus access to understanding of the minds of other living things is essential to _Ascension_.

**Beam of Fate:** A high energy weapon that defies the laws of reality and strikes instantaneously regardless of range. Its range is dependent on the power of the particular weapon. They take tremendous power and are enormously dangerous to operate, and if not engineered correctly will back fire catastrophically. Only the _Ogion_ field such weapons, and even then it is extremely rare.
