## The cult of life

**In the ultra distant future**

Life - Some cosmic savants say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. Life is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its will. All celestial bodies, whether planetoids or diffuse dust and gas, will _blindly_  follow the geometry their fate until time itself freezes...unless life comes along.

In a dead star system the largest source of energy is the star itself. A collection of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can only cause affect within the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight.

It is a miracle.

It sets in action the environment for life. And when there is life, great minds and societies may rise to harness, and even outshine those same forces. Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.

An ancient entity, born in the young universe bathed in intense radiation as a humble organism.....it evolved to perfectly perceive everything within a vast distance of itself, and to the _race-line_s that can decipher its murmurings, it calls itself _Gul Suma_ and calls life the _bright wills_. _Gul Suma_ perceives them as burning with uncertainty and chaos.

In a universe with nigh infinite failed single cellular _race-lines_, _Gul Suma_ is a singular _race-line_ that has persisted longer than even _Gul Suma_ itself can say.

Their wills crafting great constructs where _Gul Suma_ knew there would otherwise be nothing but matter..._weighted motes_...on its eternal cosmic dance. _Gul Suma_ does not know beauty, but the majority of the _Gul Suma_ family takes great pleasure when observing the _bright wills_.

_Gul Suma's_ consciousness is hosted in its sacred primal crystals in the _safe place_. The crystals always glow when many of the microscopic family members within are perceiving the acts of a living _bright will_. To the gestalt consciousness of _Gul Suma_ the _bright wills_ are sublime in their efforts to tame nature and master each other.

The _Cult of Life_ knows much and very little about _Gul Suma_, it does not know which world the being known as _Gul Suma_ resides. The cult savants do know it refers to light by its constituent wave-particles which it calls _timeless motes_, and anything made of real matter _weighted motes_.

When successfully queried if _Gul Suma_ considered itself a _bright will_? _Gul suma_ has responded yes, but one that is of the fringe length of persistence, and lack of physical constructs. As a follow up when asked if _Gul Suma_ would always be? The reply was "as long as _weighted motes_ move, and there is a sufficient well of _weighted motes_ to grasp, _Gul Suma_ will be and know all to the edge"
