## The cult of life

**In the ultra distant future**

Life - Some cosmic savants say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. Life is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its will. All celestial bodies, whether planetoids or diffuse dust and gas, will _blindly_  follow the geometry their fate until time itself freezes...unless life comes along.

In a dead star system the largest source of energy is the star itself. A collection of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can only cause affect within the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight.

It is a miracle.

It sets in action the environment for life. And when there is life, great minds and societies may rise to harness, and even outshine those same forces. Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.

_Gul Suma_ knows life as the _bright wills_ and perceives them as burning with uncertainty and chaos. Their wills crafting great constructs where _Gul Suma_ knew there would otherwise be nothing but lifeless matter on it's eternal cosmic dance. _Gul Suma_ does not know beauty, but the majority of the _Gul Suma_ family takes great pleasure when observing the _bright wills_.

_Gul Suma's_ own will is hosted in sacred primal crystals in the _safe place_, and those crystals always glow when many of the microscopic family members within are perceiving the acts of a living _bright will_. To the gestalt consciousness of _Gul Suma_ the _bright wills_ are sublime in their efforts to tame nature and master each other, and sometimes themselves.

The _Cult of Life_ knows much about _Gul Suma_, but it does not know anything about which world the being known as _Gul Suma_ actually resides. They know it refers to light by it's constituent wave-particles which it calls _timeless motes_. _Gul Suma_ also treats solid matter the same, calling anything made of atomic constituents _weighted motes_.
