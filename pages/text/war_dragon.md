The magnetic node auto-gun AKA plasmagneto repeating bolter AKA 'War Dragon'

From the historical account of the high-imperator praetorian guard Captain _Xixique Has'purga_:

  I saw the imperial phalanx, which had stood for thousands of heber (heber ~ .75 years), be crushed within moments by the demon witch that called herself _Les'ta Domiata_....she unleashed a weapon of pure death upon the holy sons of the emperor...all that it struck turned to flames and ash, their shields irrelevant...their armor meaningless...somehow, while slaying my brothers, she gravely wounded our _dear father_ ...

  Our broken emperor appeared cut in a half at the foot of his throne, I could only see one of his legs at the steps of the throne...two of his arms were ruined stumps, while his remaining two hung limp and bloodied...hundreds of dred knights lay dead and burning...I will never forget the smell of burning metal mixed with charred flesh and bone...

  it was clear we stood no chance of getting close to demon witch...she said something to the emperor and next thing he is ordering us to lay down our arms and surrender the eternal throne.

In many Languages, the word 'dragon' is a name for an apex creature, both real and mythological, which brings fire and death.

The magnetic node auto-gun has earned the _Ogion_ informal name of 'War Dragon'.

It is a weapon that deals death indiscriminately in the form of magnetically contained plasma bolts which explode in all-consuming flames (vaporizing fire) and extreme electric potential upon impact. Unless a target has relativistic shielding, or contra-therma armor the damage is often lethal from even a glancing blow
