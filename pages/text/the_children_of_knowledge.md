### Chapter 1

#### The Children of Knowledge

The universe is vast in space and time. Those empires that can claim to be 'spacefaring' are the rarest indeed. For most _race-lines_ that pierce the void the sheer vastness of space undoes any semblance of a unified society. Instead they splinter and become islands, with cultures that bear less and less resemblance to each other as relentless time ticks. Wars of pride and heraldry bleed the wild stars of progress and strength. Over the metadex, through evolutionary deviation and recombination of the sub-species the original culture and resemblances is often lost entirely.

So it _almost_ was for the _Su'rah'ty_ from their ancestral sector in the galaxy _Set'Araapponos_ they were sired under triplet stars that shone onto many planets which the ancestors of the _Su'rah'ty_ would in time tame. Whatever the ancestors of the _Su'rah'ty_ called themselves is lost to them, now they simply call their ancestors the _first ones_ and their ancient home _Cradle_. Born in the oceans of _Cradle_ the _first ones_ quickly dominated all ocean and land, and like so many young gene lines turned on themselves for a great length of time which they call the _barbaric age_.

The _first ones_ were a species attuned to all things of the electro-magnetic spectrum, and by and large were a curious and skeptical. They were immensely intelligent and through their technology could bend nature in advanced ways during the _barbaric age_. When they fell upon each other they also brought apocalyptic ruin to their once pristine home. Wars lasting many soral cycles raged in _Cradle's_ oceans. During this time they took more to the land. This was at first as a strategic advantage, and then as a separate culture. While the oceans boiled and the land burned, the first gene line splinter from the _first ones_ was born. The _Su'rah'ty_ call the land dwellers _Xur'ki_ or _the exalted_ and the ones that remained in the sea _Tam'si_ or _the founders_.

The end of the _barbaric age_ was marked with the _Hesta'raki wars_, named for the _Hesta'raki_ state which lead the

 In time they began to explore and then colonize _Setura_ which was also planet in orbit of _Cradle's_ three suns, but far colder. It is recorded that _Setura's_ oceans would have been frozen solid if not for its exceptional tides and hot core. On the ice blasted world of _Setura_ the _first ones_ began their mastery of the void, and became the first of many splinters of the _first ones_. Within a few tekadex of the _Setura_ kingdoms founding the _first ones_ continued to reach out, until every large gravity well in the _Cradle_ system was occupied by the ever varied gene line of the _first ones_.

To the planets farthest from _Cradle's_ three stars they gave names of ancient deities that ruled their primordial deep black oceans, the farthest two being _Di'amos_ and _Tell'utura_. With no surface and many moons the kingdoms of those gas worlds produced a void borne clan named _Sok'sha_. Within a few soradex of its founding, the _Sok'sha_ dissented from the inner worlds, their void culture even more alien than the splintered _first ones_ spread across the _Cradle_ system which they had named _Hos'kos_.





The rare _race-lines_ that are able to cross the gulfs within galaxies without sacrificing generations to the void are able to create vast empires with truly astronomical power. One such empire is the _The Children of Knowledge_, united under the supreme power of the _Su'rah'ty_ _race-line_. They have naturally evolved abilities. The history of their _race-line_ was especially chaotic and brutal, as their hyper evolved intelligence enabled them wield weapons of ever greater magnitude against eachother.

 _The Children of Knowledge_ know that the secrets to traveling faster than light, gravity, or anything else must be carefully guarded. The secret was theirs alone in the whole of the _Axoil'iate_ galaxy and was guarded with lethal jealously, and the aid to build an intra-galactic network for faster than light travel was sold for astronomical sums. They are ensured vast more sums for the maintenance of the network for only they could work with energies necessary

The _Star Blade_ casts a shadow greater than most moons when in high orbit. The

"Knowledge is the way" said the _Accarpia_
"And may you find it" replied the _Grand Nexus_ with his blessing.

They had delivered excellent news, and his _Ex'tkoro_ guards parted before her exit of the _throne bridge_.
