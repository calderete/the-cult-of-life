### The Warriors Way

_"Whoever you are, there is place for you in the Oro Grappa"_ -unknown

For all of her young life _Erepadie_ had been the stuff of dreams for Neta Domiata, the red moon that crawled with magic lights had always captured her imagination. When it was not in the sky she would gaze at the smaller, bare moon _Isiopophie_, patiently waiting for magical _Erepadie_. She had learned to mark time longer than the caldex day-night cycle of _Daratia_ by the rising of the great moon _Erepadie_ its illuminated surface overlapped with crescent twilight shadows cast from the planets and suns of the _Ditama_ system. "What are those?" had been one of her first questions she remembers asking, her small fingers following the lighted channels and lines that crossed over the moon. "They are _Sonovia_ like us" her smiling mother had replied. With immense wonder filling her mind at the possibilities she excitedly asked "_Sonovians_? like you and my sisters?!? How did they get there!? Are they coming back!?" Laughing, her mother told her "oh Neta, they flew up there, some come back when they can" more laughing, she loved her mothers laugh. "there are no younglings though" she informed her small racing mind "Oh? Can I ever go there?" her voice small next to her mother's vibrant tone. "Maybe you will, one day" her mother replied, the smile and laughing gone from her voice. "why only me?" she had hugged her mother as she spoke, sad now for reasons she did not know. "One day, when you are grown you will be able to decide if you wish to live on the great moon. I choose my place to be here, to be your mother" There was so much warmth in her mothers voice, it had made her confused and conflicted, and most of all very sad "I don't want to grow up and choose" she had said finally. Mother smiled again "When you are the age of choosing, you will think differently" She remembered only happiness from the rest of that caldex cycle.

When she reached her 8th caldex she began the age of learning, when her mother would teach her about the universe, and what her place in it was. For the next 20 caldex she learned everything her mother taught her. She told Neta "At first you will only learn in small amounts, as a _Sonovia_ your mind and body can change to meet any challenge" She was smiling as she always did. "as you become able to learn more, I will teach you more" 











"The _Eternal Alliance_ protects the worthy and it is the _Oro Grappa_ that raises the warriors that protect" said the statue's plaque, Neta Domiata was standing in front of the _Voro Gata_ temple on the moon _Erepadie_ which orbited the _Sonovian_ homeworld of _Daratia_.

"Iron is abundant and strong, "





The _Oro Grappa_ serves the _Ogion_ guardianship by producing and fielding its warriors. Individuals are recruited and transcripted from all _race-lines_ within the _Eternal Alliance_.
