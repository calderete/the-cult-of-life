### The Princess of War

_"Whoever you are, there is place for you in the Xi'ro'gradexa"_ - unknown

_"the sonovia are raised with care"_ - Hira-se slander

For all of her early life _E'repadie_ had been the stuff of dreams for Neta Domiata, the red moon that crawled with magic lights had always captured her imagination. When it was not in the sky she would gaze at the smaller, bare moon _Isiopophie_, patiently waiting for magical _E'repadie_. She learned to mark time longer than the caldex day-night cycle of _Daratia_ by the rising of the great moon _E'repadie_ its red surface lighting up with pinprick lights as the crescent shadows of _Daratia_ and _Isiopophie_ moved across it. From her observations, she formed the concept of ten distinct cycles of the great moon for her every name day.

"What are those?" had been one of the first questions she remembers asking, her small fingers following the lighted channels and lines that crossed over the moon in twilight. "They are _Sonovia_ like us" her smiling mother had replied. With immense wonder filling her mind at the possibilities she excitedly asked "_Sonovians_? like you and my sisters?!? How did they get there!? Are they coming back!?" Laughing, her mother told her "oh Neta, they flew up there, some come back when they can" more laughing, she loved her mothers laugh. "there are no younglings though" she informed her "Oh...can I ever fly up there?" her voice small next to her mother's vibrant tone. "Maybe you will, one day..." her mother replied, the smile and laughing gone from her voice. "why only me?" she had hugged her mother as she spoke, sad now for reasons she did not know. "One day, when you are grown you will be able to decide if you wish to live on the great moon. I choose my place to be here, to be your mother" The warmth in her mothers voice made her confused and very sad "I don't want to grow up and choose" she had said finally. Mother smiled again "When you are the age of choosing, you will think differently" Her mother promised to teach Neta more about _E'repadie_ one day, and she remembered only happiness from the rest of that caldex (~day) cycle.

Neta's days were full of playing with her twelve sisters in the _parkartia_, they would explore from park to park and play games their mothers had taught them, like _loop ball_ and _mat'rata_ until they heard the _Psio-call_ to come home. All the while she would see watch _E'repadie_ rise and fall...taking her early childhood with it.

Her name-day came and went until her 8th, on that day, when her automaton awoke her, her mother told her she would be sending her _Psio-call_ to come home earlier than normal, because today she would begin the age of learning. _Neta_ was very excited, so many curiosities had begun forming in her mind, her creators had tuned her will so, and her mother knew to begin feeding it soon.

As her mother had said, she heard her call in her mind - not a voice just her mother's will that she return - earlier than normal. Her sisters also heard the _Psio-call_, all of them stopping in their tracks just before starting the last round of a game of _loop ball_. They all looked at each other and smiled, Neta realized they were also excited. The group of twelve sisters hurriedly returned home.

When she returned home they went outside, and her mother lead her around their home to one of the stone paths behind it. Her mother extended her hand and after a moment, the stone path dropped away in front of them and became stairs leading underneath their home. She could see clearly to the bottom, a warm clean air rose from the stone floors and walls that where at the base of the stairs, her mother went down first and Neta followed. A door opened to her right at the foot of the stairs and she went in and her mother gestured inside "This is the auditorium" A display that was the size of the entire wall glowed purple at the front of the auditorium, and facing the display in a semi-circle were 12 chairs with desks in front of them.

"Here, for the next 20 adex I will teach you all that you could ever want to know about anything" "Really?!" Neta had said, her mother recognized her excitement and couldn't help but smile "Can you teach me about _E'repadie_?!" she asked "Yes, Neta....but not at first, first you must learn more vocabulary, and also, you must learn about the elements around us" as her mother spoke _E'repadie_ appeared on the display "if I tried to tell you the story of the great moon before that, it will not make sense" _E'repadie_ began to shrink and turn, and a larger blue and green planet began to creep into view, on the other side of the big planet _Isiopophie_ also began to slide into view "...that is the way it will be with many things that you will be curious about...some things have a very long story, but the longer stories are always the most interesting" Neta nodded and thought for awhile, then asked "Tsha'Te, makes pictures of the moons and suns, could you teach me that?" If she could not yet know its story, she could make pictures of it she thought "Of course!" her mother replied, Neta smiled back, her young _Sonovia_ mind an obedient sponge, with a small but persistent hunger for knowledge.

As her mother began her first lessons to Neta, she told her of the two subjects they would learn about. One was _vor'tement_ and the other was _nata'umu_. She told her "..._vor'tement_ is an old _sonovian_ word that means "the fabric of reality", and _nata'umu_ means "the wills that use", more simply, to know _vor'tement_ is to know what makes everything around you, and to know _nata'umu_ is to know how things live and thrive off of reality...they are many sub-subjects within these, but everything I will teach you will be part of those two subjects...each subject will have its own vocabulary, and we will start each subject by learning its vocabulary...there are many examples of what you will learn in the parks in the _parkartia_..." As her mother talked Neta's mind took in the new information, and questions about possibilities took shape. She'd never given much thought to reality...why would she need to? But those that had made her gene-matrix knew their craft well...and once she began to ponder what made up the things around her, and where they came from, she could not stop.

 Within a few ritodex of starting her age of learning, they crossed paths with one of her brothers "Your bothers grow much larger than us" her mother had once told her while explaining their role as care takers of the automatons that served them. Their trip this time took them through a park close to their home and one of the _Sim'aratta_ (architect-steward) - the brothers of the _Sonovian_ - was studying something along a path, from far away he had looked almost normal size, but up close she could see that her mothers head barely came above his knee, his legs where wider than Neta and her mother's bodies, each of his eyes was the size of her head. "Hello Thora" the giant had said with a voice to match his presence "Hello Shem, this is Neta Domiata my daughter" as a _Sonovian_ Neta feared little, but she was nervous and found it hard to meet his large eyes "Hello" she finally managed. "Hello" Shem said, and asked "Have you started the age of learning yet?" "Yes" she replied "You are the first of her brothers she has met" her mother added. "Ah you are a Domiata?" "yes that is my first surname" she answered as Shem knelt so that his head was a much closer height to Neta's "I am Shem Poe" he continued speaking much lower for her ears "my brothers and I are fixing an automaton array, you won't likely see us around unless something breaks, and that rarely happens" Shem said with a smile and a wink. Neta didn't know what to make of all of it, but she liked her brother Shem and smiled back.

"Why are they so big?" Neta had asked as they left the park, and began to walk back home. "They were made that way, just as we were made to be like we are" Neta thought a moment and said "Why are we so small?" after awhile her mother responded "the _Jin Mat'aridix_, made our brothers to be large and strong, they tend to be kind mannered, and natural builders and engineers...." She told them the _Sonovia_ brothers where called _Sim'aratta_ and the sisters where called _Vet'herad_, her _Sonovian_ mind effortlessly absorbing the new information. ".....the _Vet'herad_, like you and me are blessed with courage, and our nature is that of a hunter and a leader...as I hope you will be one day" Neta was confused "A hunter? why would I need to hunt anything?" "You would never need to for yourself, but for those that need it, in the _Erappa_, when we start to learn about the creatures among the stars I will teach you more Neta" she said, smiling now "I need to teach you some more vocabulary before then" she told her "Ok" Neta responded, only slightly disappointed...the creatures of the stars? she thought.. "After we learn some more on the properties of the elements we will begin to learn about the stars" her mother assured her.

"Do we come from the _Jin Mat'aridix_?" Neta asked after they had progressed closer to home "what do you mean 'come from?''" They had just learned about life cycles and Neta's mother knew where this was going, she started leading them towards high ground. "Are we born from them?" Neta asked? "No...we are born in something like the birds in the trees, but instead of growing in an egg, we are grown in a machine" They had come next to a hill and her mother lead them to the top and pointed to a shiny place on the horizon. "Over there in the city is a place called _Vuri Cata_ and it is where you were born. After Neta's eyes adjusted and focused on the spot her mother pointed to she could begin to make out shiny needles poking into the sky and tiny moving dots among them. "I was born there? That is a city?" Neta she had just learned the word _city_ "Yes, it's called _Jol_ it is the largest city on _Daratia_. You spent 4 adex in the _Vuri Cata_, we are given many gifts from the _Jin Mat'aridix_ and our bodies take longer than most to be born..." "the gestation period?" "yes Neta" "that is a long time" Neta observed. As they walked back to their home, Neta asked her mother everything she could about the city of _Jol_, and the _Vuri cata_, she only understood some of her mother's answers to the former, and almost nothing of the later.

"Are you looking forward to learning about the stars Neta?" mother asked her on the start of the 2nd caldex of the 8th kaydex in her 3rd adex of learning, she very much did look forward to it. "Yes! Shurae still says the great moon is red because there is spilt _grod_ berries everywhere I don't think she really believes it anymore though" her mother seemed amused at Neta's sister Shurae, but did not miss the opportunity to test her daughter "and why would you think she is now doubting her...interesting hypothesis?". "organic materials do not persist, sunlight would have bleached the red out long ago" Neta responded. "but what if there was an unlimited source of _grod_ juice" her mother returned, Neta wrinkled her nose while trying to imagine what could supply so much smelly _grod_ juice "I don't think so" Neta half giggled. "Well you are right, organic compounds do not persist, not without a will...and grod berries do not think for themselves..."

In her 4th adex of learning, she was introduced to the species of the void. "Life, grows and evolves...most stay confined to their gravity well..." As her mother spoke pictures of creatures floating among vast clouds, and great leviathans swimming in world wide oceans scrolled past on the auditorium display. "Some make their way into the void, and spread among the stars...they are known as void bourn lineages, and the rest are primordial gene-lines....our gene-matrix is made of many void bourn lineages, woven together by the _Jin Mataratix_"

The moons had been placed to be where they are now Neta learned ".....the _Ogion Da'tumix_ placed _E'repadie_ there 41 metadex ago...." and before that she told her, _E'repadie_ had been one of many moons inhabited by machines orbiting a planet of machines. "It now has an artificially maintained atmosphere with oxygen, which has turned the iron rich soil red..."




Final report from Ardo Tedatron recovered by Master archaeologist of the Arch'archivists

To: Remohex Tecca'dox, Primary Strata-matrix of Drexas-Primus

Remohex, the Xerex have brought monsters with them, masters of living metal, with war machines the size of planetiods! They have sabotoged the eternal sisters, Ogo'dredex warned us before firing.....they destroyed the gun counter weights, I fear we will be over run soon, I'm copying this message to all of our data vaults, and broadcasting it with auto-store instructions.

We have slain their initial forces, they seem to be on orders to inflict as much death and destruction as possible, our lighter forces were lured into the next engagement and although we repelled them the native infantry and armor have taken heavy casualties. Whoever these new allies are, if they were alone, we could take them, but Xerex death knights continue to take a toll, despite heavy casualties. They carry out targeted strikes against the city infrastructure, despite Ogo'dredex engaging they still break through and have caused great damage.

The Xerex new allies are getting closer, and I am certain that with the next orbital cycle, they will conduct a co-coordinated attack and overwhelm our forces










"The _Eternal Alliance_ protects the worthy and it is the _Xi'ro'gradexa_ that raises the warriors that protect" said the statue's plaque, Neta Domiata was standing in front of the _Voro Gata_ temple on the moon _E'repadie_ which orbited the _Sonovian_ homeworld of _Daratia_.

"Iron is abundant and strong, "





The _Xi'ro'gradexa_ serves the _Ogion_ guardianship by producing and fielding its warriors. Individuals are recruited and transcripted from all _race-lines_ within the _Eternal Alliance_.



The Gahn dojo:

Staccato clangs rang out in a rising and failing pattern, echoing from the stone floor and columns of the Gahn dojo. In an open space of the _kototorium_ Neta face her tenth and final opponent. As she attacked and defended the clangs sounded faster, and then slower as she parried, blocked and repositioned for another assault or counter attack. She weilded two _rek si_, iron rods the length or her arms with one end sharpened, she was much under armed compared to her four armed opponent.

He was a _Carvia'neoq_, and was powerfully built with four muscular legs giving it stability to wield immense strength and land crushing blows. He stood twice as tall as her and was clad in chrome armor with a mail mesh underneath. Each of his fists was gauntleted, in one he held a trident, in another a spear with a broad triangular head, and in his other two were long curved swords.

As far as Neta could tell, they had fought to a stale mate.

She moved fast and constantly performing the same leaps and spins she had durning her dance lessons long ago, but now powered by legs that could run around worlds. She counter his height by leaping above him and striking at him the air, but her blows slid sparking off of his armor without leaving a trace, and her stabs between his plate had caught harmlessly in the mesh. The fight had been going for several interum (interum = 100 seconds) and the _Carvia'neoq_ showed no signs of tiring.
