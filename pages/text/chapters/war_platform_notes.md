The Segetum Victron's War Platforms followed the Archon's rule of generality, designed for waging battle on planets, be they worlds of ocean, sand or fire; they could even be employed in open space for boarding and siege operations. They were most at home cruising through the sky, or landed on its eight legs; a walking flying castle of Hyterilian armor. Each leg was matched with a pylon which extended from the center. At the end of each pylon were held the outer citadels, each one thousands of feet tall and wide enough that all eight would encircle the central platforms when retracted.
