The castle of storms is a battle/administration station. The name "Castle of storms" refers to the once landborne stone caste which the station was built to house.

For a million adex (~years) the stone castle stood on their ancient birth world Vemi'yut. When it was built, it overlooked a sea, which eventually dried up. It was the center of power for the state of Buri'alia which united Vemi'yut after a series of catastrophes knows as the end times.

For three million adex, the castle of storms has been mounted at the top of the crystal dome in the center of the giant space fortress which is also named the "Castle of Storms".

The footfalls of the empress became audible once her escort halted at the entrance of the great stone gate which her ancient family had named the Griffin Door. As she walked, her steps echoing off of the stone doors and battlements that reached 200 lirhetta (~meters) above the _ancestors_ gardens that lead to the Castle of Storms.

Even though there was an enemy —a lone champion under heavy guard— in the castle, the old tradition stood; the empress is safe nowhere, if not in the ancestors garden. On the serene walk, she paid tribute to her ancestors, and she reflected on them and this moment, never to deceive herself in her thoughts; as was her duty to her people.

What would you say if you were me? Here and now? Their advice comes with every breath of the clean air of the garden. Father? Grandfather? You would make a spectacle of it I'm sure. The time is different, now we lead a coalition of alien souls with alien creeds. Making a spectacle could be received in an unintended way. It would also make the deception I wish to make much more difficult; the deception for which, you would surely, —perhaps justifiably— call me a traitor.

Her ancestors —thousands of generations ago— built the Ruducor pedestal. A simple tall, square monument to the heirs of the Castle of Storms. A spiral stair is cut into the slightly tapered sides of the of the pedestal. At the top, surrounded by symbolic ponds and short grasses planted in rich dirt* are the ancient battlements of the original Castle of Storms.
