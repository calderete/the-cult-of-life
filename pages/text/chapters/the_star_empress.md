The castle of storms is a battle/administration station. The name "Castle of storms" refers to the once landborne stone caste which the station was built to house.

For a million adex (~years) the stone castle stood on their ancient birth world Vemi'yut. When it was built, it overlooked a sea, which eventually dried up. It was the center of power for the state of Buri'alia which united Vemi'yut after a series of catastrophes knows as the end times.

For three million adex, the castle of storms has been mounted at the top of the crystal dome in the center of the giant space fortress which is also named the "Castle of Storms".

The footfalls of the empress became audible once her escort halted at the entrance of the great stone gate which her ancient family had named the Griffin Door. As she walked, her steps echoing off of the stone doors and battlements that reached 200 lirhetta (~meters) above the _ancestors_ gardens that lead to the Castle of Storms.

Even though there was an enemy —a lone champion under heavy guard— in the castle, the old tradition stood; the empress is safe nowhere, if not in the ancestors garden. On the serene walk, she paid tribute to her ancestors, and she reflected on them and this moment, never to deceive herself in her thoughts; as was her duty to her people.

What would you say if you were me? Here and now? Father? Grandfather? You would make more a spectacle of it I'm sure. The time and people are different. We lead a coalition of alien souls with alien creeds.

Their advice comes to her with every breath of the clean garden air.

Her ancestors built the Ruducor pedestal —thousands of generations ago. It was a one thousand lirhetta (~meters) tall stone monument to the heirs of the Castle of Storms. A spiral stair is cut into the squared, slightly tapered sides of the of the pedestal. If a traveler chooses to take the stair to the top, they would be able to see —etched into stainless iron set into the stone— the story of the Ruducor Royal family. At the top, are the ancient battlements of the original Castle of Storms. A straight path to its gate runs through grasses planted in rich dirt*, and a perimeter of symbolic ponds.

I wish I had time to make that walk today; there had been too much to prepare for this spectacle though —a shame. All the elevators are stopped today; waiting for me. Waiting for justice.

Father. Grandfather. Ancestors. I fear today you will tremble at my deeds.
