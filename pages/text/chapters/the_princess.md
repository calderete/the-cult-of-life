In the serene weightless darkness of her early life the songs of the _Vuri Cata_, made up Neta's world, the formless notes took her on short term journeys, from consonance to dissonance to resolution, and eventually fading to silence. When there was no music, her mind would wander and she would sleep, the melodies sometimes replaying her dreams, only for her to wake again to new combinations of notes and harmonies.

On and on this went, her growing mind content to travel wherever the changing music took her

After an imperceptibly long time she began to hear different things within the music, she had been content for so long with the music in her pod, and now there was something new. As her mind focused on the new stimulus a word came into her mind _voices_.....

She found her mind repeating it "voices", what she was hearing is called _voices_. Unknown to her infant consciousness the music of the _Vuri Cata_ plays on many spectrums, and her phenomenal _sonovian_ mind had listened to all through the countless cycles of waking and sleeping. Embedded in the the compositions of of the _Vuri Cata_ were the concepts of words of symbolic language, and now she began to hear more _voices_ and _singing_ floating just behind the endlessly changing music in the dark.

As new compositions played for her, she learned more words which she also began to hear sung to her in her dreams. She learned the word _umbilicus_ when her growing arms and hands touched it in the center of her stomach, and _setsa pod_, and _Vuri Cata_ when they were long enough to touch the insides of her enclosure. She knew that she was inside the _setsa pod_, which was inside the _Vuri Cata_, and that she was safe and content.










One of the first things the dreams whispered to her was that that the name of the thing that she felt moving around her was _E'repadie_, and that _her_ body would grow as a "..._prime-bi-pedal_ form...", with two arms, legs, eyes, and ears. In the dreams she would see herself emerging from her pod, her skin smooth, hairless and translucent pink, her elongated head dominated with very large eyes which were completely black with a shiny round mirrored pupil centered in the blackness. Below her eyes were her mouth and nose, through which she breathed, proportionally small compared to her eyes and head, her nose and mouth followed the _prime-bi-pedal_ form, in that her triangular nose had two nostrils and her mouth followed a symmetry of two.

At the ends of each arm, her hands had ten fingers, and each foot had ten toes. Some of the dreams would show her aging and she finds the deeper she sleeps the longer she will see herself age. The deeper she slept, then her arms and legs would get longer and her skin would darken to a purple color, and develop small scales her shoulders, knees and elbows. After a time the scales would smoothen out and her face would elongate and the angles of her jaw became sharper in relation all the while the lobe at the back of her head would lengthen and begin to curve back. Her arms and legs became thicker and more angles and curves rose from her once cylinder like appendages, her shoulders and chest also grew thicker, and her neck went from being a cone made of graceful arcs to an almost square, still graceful, but strong and with competing arcs from thick muscles which rise up from her shoulders and arms as she matures.

Her dreams told her could see many forms of light and sometimes in the dreams she would see herself as if through mature _Sonovian_ eyes, and she could see her bones went from red to black, and her blood went from red, to a deep red and finally a deep purple.
