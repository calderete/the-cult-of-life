In the serene weightless darkness of her early life, at first Neta only had the songs of the _Vuri Cata_ to keep her company. At first the music was formless, the notes playing in her pod took only short term journeys, from consonance to dissonance to resolution, only occasionally quieting to silence. In the silence, her mind would wander and sleep, only for her to eventually again become aware of the harmonies and melodies of the music which would so gradually increase in volume, that Neta's mind often found itself following without even knowing which point was silence, and in which was melody.

The music was ever changing, and after a time, she began to hear different things with the music, they were sounds she knew even though she did not know how she knew the sounds. They were whispers of words that she would her in her dreams given to her from the _Vuri Cata_, she did not know what they meant...

in which she could hear in her mind the names of things, and she would see those things in her mind as they were in the out side world, at first as abstract shapes and then sharper the more times the dream came to her, they told her the dreams were coming from the _Vuri Cata_.

She could feel her umbilicus going into her center and it was made of something hard but also soft and flexible but we she knew was not her, and the amniotic fluid and the smooth surface her pod and darkness, until one caldex (day)

_Vuri Cata_, sometimes she would get the sense of large things moving in the mist, and as her sense of what her dream was showing her grew sharper, she could make out her pod was one among many and the brightness was from the many shiny surfaces. Large shadows cast from the same shiny buildings created her sense of large things lurking in the mist.

along with things she did not understand "...you are a hero...a _sonovia_ senses all...you will see stars soon...you are a miracle...this place is a miracle...". Mostly though, the dreams showed her mind things which efficiently absorbed the knowledge through a similar spectrum with which the dreams came to her. Once her forming mouth began to move, they told her she would be able to use that to speak one day as well.

All the while they would occasionally whisper, usually something they had already said but sometimes they said something new.

One of the first things the dreams whispered to her was that that the name of the thing that she felt moving around her was _E'repadie_, and that _her_ body would grow as a "..._prime-bi-pedal_ form...", with two arms, legs, eyes, and ears. In the dreams she would see herself emerging from her pod, her skin smooth, hairless and translucent pink, her elongated head dominated with very large eyes which were completely black with a shiny round mirrored pupil centered in the blackness. Below her eyes were her mouth and nose, through which she breathed, proportionally small compared to her eyes and head, her nose and mouth followed the _prime-bi-pedal_ form, in that her triangular nose had two nostrils and her mouth followed a symmetry of two.

At the ends of each arm, her hands had ten fingers, and each foot had ten toes. Some of the dreams would show her aging and she finds the deeper she sleeps the longer she will see herself age. The deeper she slept, then her arms and legs would get longer and her skin would darken to a purple color, and develop small scales her shoulders, knees and elbows. After a time the scales would smoothen out and her face would elongate and the angles of her jaw became sharper in relation all the while the lobe at the back of her head would lengthen and begin to curve back. Her arms and legs became thicker and more angles and curves rose from her once cylinder like appendages, her shoulders and chest also grew thicker, and her neck went from being a cone made of graceful arcs to an almost square, still graceful, but strong and with competing arcs from thick muscles which rise up from her shoulders and arms as she matures.

Her dreams told her could see many forms of light and sometimes in the dreams she would see herself as if through mature _Sonovian_ eyes, and she could see her bones went from red to black, and her blood went from red, to a deep red and finally a deep purple.
