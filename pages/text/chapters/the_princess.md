In the serene weightless darkness of her early life the songs of the _Vuri Cata_ made up Neta's world, the melodious notes took her on short journeys, from consonance to dissonance to resolution, and eventually fading to silence. In the silence, her mind would wander and she would sleep, the melodies sometimes replaying her dreams, only for her to wake again to new combinations of notes and harmonies.

On and on this went, her growing mind content to travel wherever the changing music took her

After a long, long time she began to hear new sounds within the music, flowing from underneath and behind the melodies. The new sounds had the same qualities as the notes, but seemed to contain more. As she focused on the new stimulus, a word came to her from deep in her mind _voices_.....

She found her mind repeating it "voices", what she was hearing was called _voices_. Unknown to her infant consciousness the music of the _Vuri Cata_ plays on many spectrums, and her phenomenal _sonovian_ mind had listened to all through the countless cycles of waking and sleeping. Embedded in the the compositions of of the _Vuri Cata_ were the concepts of words and symbolic language.

As new compositions played for her, she learned more words which she also began to hear sung in her dreams. She learned the word _umbilicus_ when her growing arms and hands touched the hard, yet soft, tube in the center of her stomach, and _setsa pod_, and _Vuri Cata_ when they were long enough to touch the insides of her enclosure.

Neta's small growing mind was content knowing that she was inside the _setsa pod_, which was inside the _Vuri Cata_, and that she was safe.

As time went and her body and senses grew, she began to hear with more than just her two ears, her _psoto oculus_ or "minds ear" - an organ that descended from ears that could "listen" for light traveling on the radio spectrum - was growing and its sensations were becoming more discernible to her. Her pre mature _psoto oculus_ had been the vector through which the music of the _Vuri Cata_ had given her the concepts of words and language, and as she heard clearer with it, she learned of more ideas and _Sonovian_ sensations.

And then one day she awoke, and it was no longer dark.

"Neta time to come home for lessons!" Neta heard her mother's psio call, but she did not dare take her eyes off the emn'ste ball. Her sisters had also been called, but they also remained focused on the ball's random spiraling trajectory. Hexur had thrown the ball high and arching giving Neta plenty of time to focus her gravictic senses on the ball. In her mind and body she could sense the competing momentums inside the emn'ste ball. Inside of it the inner balls were spinning furiously in superfluid condensates and made the balls trajectory all but unpredictable, unless you were a _sonovian_...

While barely being conscious of it, she moved her hand into the inscrutable, but inevitable path for the ball to land smoothly into the _leta hook_ in her hand. As the balls within balls raced in little forced orbits in her hook, she next focused on the goal. It was a tube angled down, with its opening only slightly bigger than the ball, and only the most accurate throw would see the ball not bounce off the edges and end the round in defeat.

The sensation she felt coming from the spinning masses was one she had known since before she was born, their caged orbits making small circles in space and throwing off tiny gravity waves. As she swung her arm to throw she rotated the _leta hook_ to add an additional spin of her own choosing, and she loosed the ball in high path aimed somewhat above the target. As the ball neared the point were it seemed it might pass over the target it spiraled quickly down and through the goal without touching the sides of it. "Goal!" yelled Shurae who was the goal judge for the round.

"Excellent shot Neta, I thought maybe I passed it too high to you" Hexur said to her as they were giving their gear to the automatons to put away, "It wasn't bad, it gave me more time to feel it down" Neta replied to her sister. Neta had also replied to her mothers psio call with the sensation of her goal, her mothers reply had been full of happiness and smiles for her. "I wasn't sure it would go in at first though" Neta said with a shy giggle.

They started back through the _parkartia_ together, all twelve of them. Their homes formed a large circle, inside and outside the circle was considered the _parkartia_ which contained the parks that Neta and her sisters had spent their young lives exploring and playing in. Today they had chosen to play in park far outside their circle of homes, and their group stayed together until they came to the ring path which encircled the small neighborhood. The first two parted then quickly followed by another two, and another two, always going in opposite directions until it was just Urrux and Neta, Neta gave her a quick good bye and she went to her waiting mother to begin her lessons.

Today her lessons included dance practice.
