_E'repadie_ - the great moon, has been a visitor to Neta's dreams for as long as she could dream, floating in her gestation pod she could feel it moving around her slowly far away. Her lightless existence was mostly filled with waking dreams given to her by the _Vuri Cata_ temple, in which her pod would spend four adex cycles (~four years) while her mind and body grew. The dreams had told her these things themselves, along with things she did not understand "...you are a miracle...you are a hero...you will see stars soon...".

The dreams told her, her body would grow as a "..._prime-bi-pedal_ form...", with two arms, legs, eyes, and ears, she would often hear a whisper also say "...the sacred hunter form...". In the dreams she would see herself emerging from her pod, her skin smooth, hairless and translucent pink, her elongated head dominated with very large eyes which were completely black with a shiny round mirrored pupil centered in the blackness. Below her eyes where her mouth and nose, through which she breathed, proportionally small compared to her eyes and head, her nose and mouth followed the _prime-bi-pedal_ form, in that her triangular nose had two nostrils and her mouth followed a symmetry of two.

At the ends of each arm, her hands had ten fingers, and each foot had ten toes. Some of the dreams would show her aging, her arms and legs would get longer and her skin would darken to a purple color, and develop small scales her shoulders, knees and elbows. After a time the scales would smoothen out and her face would elongate as would the lobe at the back of her head.

Sometimes in the dreams she would see herself as if through mature _Sonovian_ eyes, which her dreams told her could see many forms of light, and she could see her bones were black, and her blood was very deep purple.




She dreamed about many things then, things that her creators the _Jin Mataratix_ had put into her mind to play again and again, but always the great moon was there in dreams and in waking. For four dark and peaceful adex (~four years) she was always aware something far away and always moving around her. As her fingers grew longer and she was able to open her hand.
