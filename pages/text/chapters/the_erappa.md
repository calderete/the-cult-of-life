Erappa is a word meaning "wildlands"

The erappa is what _Genet Cosmicae_ call areas that are inhabited by the "free races" _Genet Segea_

Once there was only the Erappa, before the ascendants, and before the protectorate, all was the erappa. In the erappa are the high empires and kingdoms, and the freelands all inhabited by the proud and the free.

To be in the protectorate means to submit as a vassal to the Ogion eternal alliance. If they qualify a civilization must make the decision to serve something greater than themselves, and in return are given protection and the resources to thrive.

First contact in the erappa is done through an envoy when possible


### Message to the Wildlands

Oblivion is inevitable prepare for it
Only the living can choose their fate

Beware of dragons and demons
Beware of myth and superstition
Beware of saviors, emperors, and kings

The protectorate finds the worthy


### The Protectorate

The protectorate is an alliance which offers mutual protection and resources against natural and unnatural disasters as well as access to their FTL travel and communication networks.

To gain entry to the protectorate a government of a people must demonstrate they are a cosmic race. _Genet Cosmicae_
A _Genet Cosmicae_ society will treat all of its governing people as equal. It will value the sanctity of life in all its forms(animals cannot be enslaved for food).

They must also be committed to "Cosmic Works" such as breaking the frontier, keeping the peace, or building great constructs.

All protectorate members start as lesser vassals. Over time as they thrive, they will become greater vassals and finally, ascendant vassals.
