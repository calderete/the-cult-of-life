## The Harvest

The black galleons sailed low, the sky aflame in their wake as they descended. The day of parting had come. Sparking black flecks detached from their main hulls and sped off in every direction, they were the _Xoto Drehm_, servants of the galleon captains, the _Skregi Xi'to_, off to retrieve a "special" tithe.

"Jeh'hemar please let them spare us..." Ariator didn't think his wife's prayers would make any difference...but so did saying nothing "Jeh'hemar willing..." he squeezed her hand and she moved closer to him, Shes'ta had never been his most affectionate partner, but everyone held each other closer on the day of parting.

"Do you think they go to a better place?" she asked, Ariator never knew how to answer her "...they bring us the mana of the stars, they must be going to a land of plenty" He was lying....any elder who had seen what the _Xoto Drehm_ do those that resist knew the truth, the _Hek'treem_ were an enslaved people.

It was the feeling among the elders that whatever fate awaited the departed, it was not one of happiness. He could not bring himself to share those feelings with Shes'ta, as much as he wanted to. When he dwells on those thoughts, it sparks an abyssal sadness which consumes him. And as much as it would comfort him - as all sadness desires company - he also wished to spare her those black thoughts if he could.

"What would life be like if we could all grow old together?" Shes'ta said "...by the codex of _Drem_ the mana would cease to fall, and there would be endless famine..." Ariator responded to the blasphemy with the standard reply to such things. "Is this all we are meant to be, to maybe live long enough to have children, that you will love and loose, to eventually be taken away to....something...." with the last word she threw her arm towards the sky and lost the last syllable in her choking throat.

Ariator didn't know what to say, he looked in the direction of the stair which led to the area on their home's roof known as an _operarie_ where, by the codex of _Drehm_, his children waited on the day of parting, and he wondered which would be gone when the black galleons left.

"When our time comes, we will be reunited" he repeated the codex verse reflexively and his voice betrayed how little he believed it. He could feel the abyss closing on him again.

He didn't notice her look of sadness at his reply or the tears in her eyes, he didn't feel their home start to shake as the massive galleons passed overhead. Only the cries of their youngest brought him back to the present. He could see columns of light reaching down from some galleons in the distance, and knew his children would be seeing the same above them on the _operarie_. The youngest - twins who had yet to be named - were experiencing the disorienting feeling of the gathering light for the first time and they were frightened. If they were still there after today, they could be named. Ariator didn't dare hope for a such a happiness after a lifetime of heartbreak, even if it was likely the twins would be spared.
