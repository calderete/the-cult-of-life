It was a bug hunt. I hate bug hunts, hive swarmers feel no pain, and dispense it without mercy. My job is much harder on bug hunts. What do they want with this shadt hole of a world anyway? It's not very green, the weather matches the landscape, bleak and uninviting. Despite the grey clouds, rain has not touched this dusty ground in a long time she guessed; there was plenty of lightning though, blue and white snaps that complimented the angles of the terrain. Legionatus command had been sent her squad to these mountains to find a local militia that had gone missing; after they themselves had gone in search of a missing citizen. This mission will end like they usually do she thought —lots of dead bugs.

At least it's easy to tell friend from foe. Prix's eyes caught a spiny shadow moving far ahead of her squad.

"Dixo two, movement ahead"
Dixo: "copy"

The troopers fired their mag bolters into a pouring swarm coming from the low rocks, bolter reports mixing with sharp bangs from the expolding bolt ammunition. That's 20..21..22, her nero-interface updating command with the number of dead swarmers. Gotta remember to keep an eye on the rocks above...I can't see anything with all that interference. After what she estimated was at least 60 swarmers getting gunned down the din of gunfire abruptly stopped. The attack seems over.

A blinking amber symbol in her upper HUD told her the boss wanted an update. "Squad I see all green?" Each trooper confirmed through their own interface no injuries; lighting up 14 green dots in the lower right corner of her HUD. "Command we are all clear" Commander Ter Hemner should be pleased at our efficiency?

Not by his tone....
Hemner: "AIRBORNE INCOMING!"

 _CRAAACK_ She couldn't tell which other support trooper fired the heavy bolter shot, but she followed its victim's fall backwards to the rest of the incoming airborne swarm. In a single movement she swung her heavy bolter up to sight and meet the air ambushers. They look nasty, all talons and spines attached to wings. _CRAAACK_ her bolt went dead center through the nerve stem of one bug; it tumbled forwarded, the echoing from her shot still sounding when it plunged into the ground. _CRAACK_.._CRAACK_ two more down. Trooper mag bolters —sounding like small puffs compared to her long range rifle— joined into taking down the flyers. Seemingly syncronized with the flyers, ground swarmers charged out from the rocks and over the bodies of their fallen brethren. _BOOOMM BOOOMM BOOOMM_ guess the troopers decided to bring out the bigger munitions. _BOOOMM BOOOMM_ Yeah, splattered the last bit it looks like.

 In the corner of her HUD two of the green lights turned blue, indicating minor wounds. Looks like I'm on the clock. She powered up her position translator and teleported into the cover of some rocks near the squad. A bright flash followed by a shrieking bang giving away her movement and destination. Opening eyes that she closed to ease translation disorientation, she felt the ground under her feet, stowed her weapon, deployed her medic shield, and turned to find the wounded troopers. One of the blue dots started blinking; one of the other support troopers had gotten to the other injured trooper and was assessing.

She found the trooper in the cover of some large rocks, that troopers had set up perimeter  Both dots started blinking in her HUD. Semeshea Emyatta, callsign Emyatta 6; Sedra'hk'not, —a tough and resilient gene nexus— had sustained a deep gash; grazing a few bones; from mid abdomen, to mid chest. She had an elevated heart and seemed to be in some pain, not enough for an acid wound, no sign of poising.
