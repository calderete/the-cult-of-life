Herom might have been asleep for only setadex before he heard the klaxons. He roused with the rest of his charge, from their hibernation couches and into the dull light of the hab bay. One of recruits was the first speak "what's going on?" he asked. Herom stood to his full height, which was twice that of most in the hab bay and growled loud enough for the rest of the ship to hear "we are called to battle phalanx eight eight!!"...just then his nero-com powered up and orders began to flow to Herom "...we will not be escorting princess today!...we are assigned to Vanguard assault one!!" a few drowsy cheers rose from his troop "....ready up glory seekers!! We drop in a setadex!"
