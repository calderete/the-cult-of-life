There was Persa 77 —gunner trooper— who had the distinction of being the deadliest of the Hetra one-two gunners, often switching to her carbine and side arm instead of reloading; she had earned the ire of her instructors, but also the highest kill per shot count among her peers. Braqa 81 had earned the moniker "Tank" while still in training for his size, and ability to destroy tanks —an affinity for anti-armor demolition. When Jathur 6 reported to the Legionatus induction barracks he appeared to have no soldiering —or life— skills whatsoever; he was taken in any way, owing to the Legionatus motto "Whoever you are, there is a place for you in the legionate". In 4 years Jathur 6 had become a "capable soldier" acording to the Aqricodia instructors, and was set to deploy on time with the rest of his squad into live action.
