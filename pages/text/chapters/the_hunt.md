Galaxy: Gemi'holon
Sector: Ter'tai'deroga (erappa)
Sector: Heg Juter (Ogion Protectorate)

_open space in between the border systems of the sector (Ter'tai'deroga - Heg Juter)_


"Bring up a gravitic scan of this system!....calibrate for course to there...they've run into a bottle neck....we've got'em!" Ray'heta's enhanced voice issued from her/his oval mirror helmet while he highlighted the areas he spoke of on his navigation console with her upper arms, while their lower ones danced across the controls. Combat was expected this day, and he had donned void black armor plate which clinked mutedly under their crimson and gold trim cloak while he worked. Ray'heta had christened the ornate cloak the 'admirals cloak'. (mostly, only admirals can find gravity wells to make use of cloaks)

Their quarry - a rogue corsair frigate suspected of piracy - had made a second mistake. (the first being to flee in the direction of the core sector and crossing the protectorate frontier) and now free void-admiral Ray'heta Hy'tetra (septra'not) knew exactly where they had to translate into real space next. "It's taken two ritodex (~22 days) for us to run you down" the void-admiral said, giving their thoughts free voice to the blinking dot representing the rouge on the command console displays. "but the _Neris light_ and her attendants can jump farther..."

"The rogue must have something very valuable..." _Argo'mat_ (dedextra'not) the second adjutant of Ray'heta's command cartel said, echoing his/her own thoughts earlier. "...she jumps so franticly...burning up her engines...she waits barely a caldex and a half before jumping again...must be a pot of jewels at the end of her rainbow..."

"she dances well between the planets...." could be herd from the crew below the bridge in the instrument pits.

"Don't you think the _Neris light_ (Heavy cosmic class cruiser) and her plasma cannons are a much better reason for them to run like a salted _Jer'pi_ ??" _Ahm'gata_ (septra'not), Ray'heta's third adjutant offered. "...if you think that rusted can of piss detected us any closer than eight stardex than you must not have put on your space-shoes right today!..." _Ahm'gata_ got some chuckles from the crew with his retort..._Argo'mat_, not chuckling, replied "...forgive me brother, I lack your experience..."

The crew was losing focus thought Ray'heta, he interrupted saying to the command cartel "so what if young Argo'mat does not the specifications of every bit of scrap and rabble that flies out of the erappa...we have our paydirt to think of command crew."

"Where do we intend to corner them?" asked _Un'drema_ (regusum'vaft) The cartel's first and adjutant, proving once again in the void-admirals mind why she is also the best.

Smiling, even though know one could see, it was plain in the the void-admiral's voice they intoned "Yesss. The important things, here" while pointing to a newly summoned view of an orange and gold gas giant.

Of the many things Ray'heta was commissioned for one the most profitable was the ancient profession of pirate hunting. Ray'heta had no illusions that the protectorate saw little difference between a privateer and a rouge and it was for this reason that privateers like himself were remunerated well for hunting their kin.

Their quarry was a capable space farer, but super luminal travel is treacherous and limited by the navigation capabilities of the superluminal craft. Ray'heta had outfitted the _Neris Light_ with a hyper-entanglement interferometer array - an enormously expensive technology - which allowed them to safely jump twelve stardex (~lightyears) in charted space, and up to two in uncharted space, they knew the jump limit for the corsair was at most eight stardex in known space and less than one in unknown space. The command cartel of the _Neris Light_ had advised Ray that the corsair may be fleeing combat and may have suffered command casualties to explain its unusual course.

"There! There!" Ray said pointing to area devoid of planets "Ive got you!...ahhhh...they must translate here" the location he pointed to made the most sense as it had an unobstructed view of next system, and was devoid of bodies which could cause them to fail to translate from hyper to real space, but is was also a very large place. One of his command crew spoke up "were in this clearing should we wait?" Ray turned to face the source of the query...it was an under adjutant named Liber Ahi "ahhhh yesss adjutant Ahi... Such a large vacuum it seems they could safely drop to...but it is not so large really" he turned back to the display as he spoke.

Few had ever seen Ray without their mirrored helmet, but if they could now, they would see Ray's four eyes following the lines of gravitation in the target system and lining them up with the known course of the corsair. "you see.....their navigator will set them in place where the gravity of the main star is perpendicular to their course...." His lower arms worked the controls as his upper hands traced predicted course lines "...we know they must jump to here" he said as he pointed to the displayed system "it is the only place close enough for their little sensors...ha!, and from here they must go to the next closest place..as they are doomed to! haha...." as he spoke a circle appeared on the navigation display and hovered over a point of light "...and they must be aligned just so...since we also know which direction they must enter the gravity well of this system...there is only one such navigation node available to them..."

On the display, at the intersection of several imaginary lines and in the most empty part of that space, an eight pointed cross hair marked a spot. "...here we shall wait...when they translate...the _Neris Light_ will be there to give them a bargain...ha...hahahaha" there were a few chuckles at his joke, Ray had a special kind of humor that only a few of his crew understood. But he was not their lord admiral for his humor, he was their lord admiral because he brought in the pay and now with a potentially valuable bounty within reach his crew moved quickly to ready the ship for its jump. "Regi'atam...you think their captain is dead?" Ray addressed one of his aides-strata that had put forward the theory of why they kept such an unusual course so close to protectorate controlled sectors. "Yes lord admiral" he responded "ahhh, ahhhh, so you say..." Ray mused "...do you doubt my theory my lord?" Regi'atam asked

"I do not know....I feel...I feel...the captain is not dead...but is not well...at first..I said to myself...that they 'must have something valuable'....but now...I feel they are afraid"
"afraid of us?"
"us? ha...hahahah...no...something else has made them sacred enough to run from the safety of the lawless lands" as he talked one of his hands pointed to the edge of the display at the area marked _Erappa_, and made a line to the other edge area marked _Core sector Emhetra_ "...and run to, what is for them...a dangerous place. What I feel...is troubling me...I feel that the rogue captain has more fear of the _Erappa_, than of the protectorate"

Zemo never liked this world..._Nexi_ it was called. Things had always been odd at this port of call...little things. Mag compasses were mostly useless, even though they shouldn't be, and gear that was normally reliable had to be constantly reset. All forms of coms were unreliable, plagued with static, and prone to channels crossing. And if that was not enough reason to be wary of this place, this system was a mere two jumps to the Ogion protectorate frontier markers and the demons beyond.

The people here called them selves the _Dereese_ and they said it was not always like this, they said the strangeness started around 20 adex (~years) ago...their scientists and researchers had never been able to solve the mystery, and instead they coped...and built their tech to be as stable as it could. Zemo also found the people here odd...and he had wondered if that had not always been as well.

All of that oddness could not explain their behavior now...they had locked down that city in which Zemo's ship the _Sera Freedom_ had landed, the captain had ordered all hands back to prep to flee if needed...regardless of items unsold which he ordered left on the landing deck. Some rookie corsairs might think the captain dumb or cowardly...to them he would say, if he cared to say it, "that is the only way a rogue corsair could live as long as the captain...and being prepared to run lightly in space is always wise..."...if he cared to say it.

On the bridge they watched their sensor monitors as the _Dereese_ fleet massed above their homeworld, the captain ordered Zemo to tap into the surveillance feeds and find out what has happening. Zemo went to his station and worked quickly, the _Dereese_ did not have a mind for security and he was able to assume an trusted identity with ease. "I'm through" Zemo said through his translator "look in the western continents..." the captain ordered.

Zemo started going through feeds...they were not organized in any way many were dead static...some were of warehouses, some on streets. Zemo cycled through hundreds of feeds...warehouse after warehouse...some common areas, and more dead signals. At almost his two hundredth feed reconnect Zemo saw something strange, the feed was from a tower overlooking a market area, uniformed soldiers were herding the shopping crowd and clearing the market. "captain, you should see this" as the captain walked over the wail of sirens from outside began building and reached its crescendo when the captain looked over Zemo's shoulder to see what the found.

At the end of one of the streets that the soldiers were herding the citizens into, a panic broke out, Zemo could hear desperate screams through the audio feed while at the end of the street what looked like a fine pink mist began roiling into the crowed. Zemo watched as the panic became a visible wave moving through the crowd until the street was a surge of _Dereese_ running for their life.

After a few seconds the captain had seen enough and roared "FULL POWER TO THE ENGINES NOW!! take off NOW!!", everyone obeyed quickly and wordlessly as the fusion powered hyper thrusters spun up. Strapped in at his station Zemo watched on unbelievably.

The mist continued its wispy march into the street while horrified and screaming _Dereese_ found themselves pulled into it, their faces going from horror to mortal pain. As the mist front got closer Zemo it unveiled a scene of bloody slaughter behind it.

It was total carnage, _Dereese_ body parts and pink blood were everywhere, the stone street drained away the blood forming reverse tributaries fed by piles of death. As Zemo's mind began to grasp what he was seeing, he though he could see blood jumping and dancing in time with shiny flickers before falling like sticky rain. Something was tearing the _Dereese_ to pieces and leaving no survivors.

"I think something invisible is out there" Zemo said, as the thrusters power up and Zemo was pushed into his seat, he felt the need to say. "Derehm help us"

The cockpit of the _Sera Freedom_ lit up in blinding white ""

Ray'heta Hy'tetra had a custom body he had commissioned from a gene weaver. He was in a bipedal form with four arms and an elongated head with four eyes. They had ordered their body adapted to their exo suit. Nearly everyone that knew Ray, knew their face as but a mirror on his long oval helmet.

He had been born as a male, and would sometimes still refer to themselves as such, but the body they inhabited now, was both male and female, and had special....almost forbidden _Genex extriatia_ organs which could assimilate alien genetic material.
