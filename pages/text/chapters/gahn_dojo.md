The Gahn dojo:

Staccato clangs rang out in a rising and failing pattern, echoing from the stone floor and columns of the Gahn dojo. In an open space of the _kototorium_ (training area) Neta face her tenth and final opponent. As she attacked and defended the rhythm of the clangs sped up, and then slowed down as she parried, blocked and repositioned for another assault or counter attack. She wielded two _rek si_, iron rods the length or her arms with one end sharpened, she was much under armed compared to her four armed opponent.

He was a _Carvia'neoq_, and was powerfully built with four muscular legs giving it stability to wield immense strength and land crushing blows. He stood twice as tall as her and was clad in chrome armor with a mail mesh underneath. On his upper shoulders rested heavy pauldrons with curving sides that rose almost above his head, and each arm was covered in interlocking chrome plates. Each gauntleted fist held a weapon, in one was a trident, in another a spear with a broad triangular head, and in his other two were long curved swords.

The fight had been going for several interum (interum = 100 seconds) and the _Carvia'neoq_, her tenth opponent, showed no signs of tiring. As far as Neta could tell, they had fought to a stale mate.

She moved fast and constantly performing the same leaps and spins she had durning her dance lessons long ago, but now powered by legs that could run around worlds. Her speed she knew kept him from overwhelming her with his advantage of weaponry, and when she got close she would strike, always looking for weaknesses and finding none yet. She could smell his blood and knew her vicious stabs through his mesh had drawn some blood, but nothing mortal.

She changed her strategy by leaping above him and striking at him the air, but her blows slid sparking off of his armor and leaving no trace, and her stabs between his plate would catch harmlessly in the mesh. In turn he countered her by swinging his spear and trident high into the arc of her flight, which she would in turn counter spinning and twisting her body around and away the razor arrow head tines of the trident, or deflecting and kicking away the broad headed spear when his swings were well in her flight path.

Her objective was to defeat this opponent, his only vulnerable points she could see were his eyes, but she could not get within his swings to be in striking range of his head. A thought came to her from her real memory _most craft-masters need tools_. This _Carvia'neoq_ was a master of his tools, and she resolved to relieve him of them.

--------------------------------------------------------

She made another leaping attack but instead of moving fast to stay away she leapt again into his blindside, she summersaulted into an arch and straightened out at the apex with her head pointed down. As she fell from a height of 5 lirhetta (~5meters) and her opponent spun around to find her, his right upper arm with the spear moved into her path. As she approached his spear hand she brought her legs under her and he continued to turn, as his eyes found her it was to late. She kicked the haft of the spear deflecting it hard enough the _Carvia'neog's_ grip loosened and his weight shifted. Before he could regain his grip Neta struck his gauntleted hand with both her _rek si_. She struck with all of the strength in her body and her falling weight, the impact sent a flare of sparks bursting from his hand followed by a deafening roar from the _Carvia'neoq_ and the clanging of spear hitting the ground.

As soon as Neta hit the ground she jumped again, and again until she had a clear shot from above the left side of his head. He looked up just in time to see the end of her _rek si_ falling down towards him, he brought his unarmed, mangled hand up to block her, but she easily kicked it away. She drove her left _rek si_ deep into his eye while her right struck against a sword he had managed to bring up to her.

The _Carvia'neoq_ screams mixed with the sounds of falling steel, Neta held onto her impaling _rek si_ as he fell and as she stepped off of him, the body of the _Carvia'neoq_ vanished in flickering sliding light.

"y'all have come here to fight for glory, _*heh heh*_ but first you must learn how....unequipped you are for the universe _*ha heh*_!!" Game maestro _Drul'do_'s laughing and chuckling was unnerving to Igox...a feeling the giant _Do'tekh_ warrior was not used to.

He had been told nothing since his selection, none of them had, and none of them knew what was in store for them at the _Grid'os Uradda_. Some of his fellow selectees had thought they knew things, but Idox had recognized their superstitious theories for what they were. They had not had any time to explore their surroundings, once they had landed they were all led straight to the central temple and the several hundred selectees for this class were arrayed around a viewing balcony. Below the balcony was a large space with free standing columns and a floor which looked to be made of stone. The maestro had introduced himself from a floating disc high above the floor and just above eye level of the selectees.

"All who come to the grid must fight their way through the Gahn Dojo" the game maestro continued "...today I only see one of you that can win a deca gauntlet... _*he he*_..." the maestro was making slow circuits around the open space "...and today! _*he he*_...I've decided to be merciful _*ha*_...by letting them go first...._*haha*_....so the rest of you have a fighting chance! _*hahaha*_" many of the selectees were looking around, they were the most powerful warriors their worlds could raise all selected to become legendary immortal soldiers, but Idox could see none that did not think he could best in any match...could he mean him?

"Some of you probably think you were born to conquer the stars!! _*haha*_...well most of you are not! _*haha*_...however...our great all knowing masters have made sure...that there will always be those that are born for battle in the cosmos _*heh hehe*_" the maestro's disk had stopped its circuit and he was in front of a purple, bipedal female that Idox did not remember seeing or meeting on their journey. "...how wise they are indeed eh domiata?..." The purple girl seemed to suddenly realize she was the focus of attention, she answered the maestro

"That is my given surname"
"Oh?....and who gave you that surname?"
"The _Jin Mataratix_"
"ahhh _*heha*_ the _Jin Mataratix_...and do you know why they gave you that name?"
"No"
"It has to do with the gifts you have been given...you have been given many gifts, yes?"
"I have"

_Drul'do's_ disk flung itself to the center of the temple "...you see my worthy class she is a _sonovian_" he said gesturing back to the purple female "...a miracle of engineering by the great gene weavers, the _Jin Mataratix_...she knows no fear and has the instincts of trillions of hunters in her black bones...but you know what _*heh heh*_...even she is going to struggle against my deka gauntlet today _*hehe*_...but she is going to do much better than the rest of you I am sure..._*hahahaha*_...Neta Domiata! Gather you training weapons and go down to the _kototorium_!!"

_Do'tekh_ sized up the domiata as she made her way down...he didn't rate her much of a fighter. As the opposite doors of the _kototorium_ opened he was sure she was doomed...despite the maestros words. She was facing a _to'hedgite_, bipedal like her but much larger...and very fast..._Do'tekh_ had fought many like him and rated him a fine opponent.

_Drul'do_ layed out the simple rules of the deka gauntlet, the selectee faces ten opponents which are instanced by
The _to'hedgite_ roared





-----------------------

Drul'do: "I don't see any savants here! Do I? _hehehe_ I don't see no...engineers, no medici! Heh? Any Bietree* Builders out there? Ha! Nooooo. No pasty academics here. I see; brawlers, scrappers, fighters! Hahahahaha.... Humrego thinks you can make it to the strata as soldiers! _hehe_...Humrego knows what to look for, and so...you might make it! The savants, and engineers, and acolytes, all have places they train to master their craft. They labor for hundreds, even thousands of adexi (~years) to become MAESTROS!! Hahahah. But YOU, have this, the _kototorium_. My kototorium, where soldiers-cosmicae train to rise through the Legionatus, and into the strata."




"You are spared such pompous titles as _maestro of cage and conduit_ hahahee, no....instead we soldiers begin as novice, and if we just don't die! We rise to elite...the sy'elite!"



-----------------------





_Drul'do_ "Come not to me if you need courage or strength, I train soldiers of the _cosmicae_!!, come to the Gahn dojo"
