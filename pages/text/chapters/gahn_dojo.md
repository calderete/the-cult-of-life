The Gahn dojo:

Staccato clangs rang out in a rising and failing pattern, echoing from the stone floor and columns of the Gahn dojo. In an open space of the _kototorium_ (training area) Neta face her tenth and final opponent. As she attacked and defended the rhythm of the clangs sped up, and then slower as she parried, blocked and repositioned for another assault or counter attack. She wielded two _rek si_, iron rods the length or her arms with one end sharpened, she was much under armed compared to her four armed opponent.

He was a _Carvia'neoq_, and was powerfully built with four muscular legs giving it stability to wield immense strength and land crushing blows. He stood twice as tall as her and was clad in chrome armor with a mail mesh underneath. On his upper shoulders rested heavy pauldrons with curving sides that rose almost above his head, and each arm was covered in interlocking chrome plates. Each gauntleted fist held a weapon, in one he held a trident, in another a spear with a broad triangular head, and in his other two were long curved swords.

The fight had been going for several interum (interum = 100 seconds) and the _Carvia'neoq_, her tenth opponent, showed no signs of tiring. As far as Neta could tell, they had fought to a stale mate.

She moved fast and constantly performing the same leaps and spins she had durning her dance lessons long ago, but now powered by legs that could run around worlds.

She countered his height by leaping above him and striking at him the air, but her blows slid sparking off of his armor without leaving a trace, and her stabs between his plate would catch harmlessly in the mesh. He countered her by swinging his spear and trident high into the arc of her flight, which she would in turn counter spinning and twisting her body around the razor arrow head tines of the trident, or deflecting and kicking away the broad headed spear when his swings were well in her flight path.

Her objective was to defeat this opponent, his only vulnerable points she could see were his eyes, but she could not get within his swings to be in striking range of his head. A thought came to her from her real memory _most craft-masters need tools_. This _Carvia'neoq_ was a master of his tools, and she resolved to relieve him of them.

She knew that from certain angles he could not strike with all of his weapons...the same arms which allowed him to hold many weapons, where the same arms that blocked those weapons from striking an opponent that got close.
