Ganto was a team sport, that could wind up a one on one match. It was times like those that Prix excelled. At first it had been because her mostly male opponents would —as most male Huso do— underestimated females; especially ones playing the warden position on a Ganto battle court. Season after season she gained a reputation for winning mats'vie —final one on one— confrontations. And underestimation had turned to fear, which in turn aided her tactics and strikes. She was a legend in her prefecture of Lon'ta, already holding most of the official records for female Ganto players —and a few overall for her age class— and had propelled her team —the Sen'Lon Comet-stars— to 2 grand championships. After her first season, she had been given the moniker Ez'Rapta after the fierce tigers of the high plains. Prix Botha had risen as high as a female could in the sport of Ganto; as her adolescence waned, so too did her career as a Ganto warden.
