Every great civilization, and the great leaders they spawn, must build to be great. The Plago Ocxidux were great builders and a greater liege to the Ogion Protectorate.

In his two and a half Soradex (~250 years) Min'errie had not met an engineer as skilled as Uxur'rodex, and now that he had, he was beginning to fully understand the difference between a maestro like himself, and virtuosos like Uxur.

They stood on the main observation deck overlooking the outskirts of a fortification under construction. Massive plates of steel floated on kinetic channels above their heads and towards the fort perimeter. From their vantage point the plates formed a radiating pattern at the center of which burned a _Poroxis Forge_ several tekudex (tekudex ~= 1.5 miles) away.

The forge had been constructed in a near cube shape that tapers at the top. The air around it shimmered with heat and distortions from the caged gravity well which powered the forge. Its exhaust manifested as a bright column of light which shot straight from the forge into the air and out to space burning anything which came near it.

Extending from the forge on the ground were lines of harvesters bringing raw material to the hoppers of the _Poroxis Forge_. The hoppers were nothing more than giant funnels for dirt that flowed into a more interesting construct at their bottoms. In the space between the forge and the hoppers that surrounded it, Min'errie had designed and built, under Uxur's guidance, a self balancing _slog_ (raw material) manifold. The _slog_ for a _Poroxis Forge_ could be any normal state matter, and so the manifold had been constructed with conduits through which could flow almost anything.

The end result was a forge that would feed as fast as the harvesters could bring material. In the forge that material would be blasted, spun, sorted and run through many processes in varying degrees of pressure until the desired element is wrought. From there the molten elements flow in their own conduits and into the final forges to take whichever shape is called for.

Steel, silver, and gold ingots floated to micro forges, and finished plates and pieces were carried away by logi-automatons to the building bays and workshops.

"Have you considered sedato-kentic channels farther into the hillside?" Min'errie asked. Uxur did not look up as he answered "We would have to know the future to know the optimal". Like most virtuosos Uxur rarely saw the need to elaborate with words, especially when connected to a neuro-com. Min'errie understood that he did not wish to make to many long range logistic improvements so early in this commission.
