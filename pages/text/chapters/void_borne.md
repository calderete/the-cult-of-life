Shresta Void colony, the Gemi'holon galaxy

The border systems of the _Erappa_

As their shuttle thrusters fired to alter course, Getta'tai and Regma'tai were pushed hard into their seats and Regma had to fight for breath. "You are going too fast...our orbit is too low....we're going to get fined again" Regma'tai complained to her mate and partner "hmpf..whatever" replied Getta'tai "I didn't want to get stuck behind that _Semlous_ freighter..." Regma left it at that...in the 2 ketadex (~20 years) they had been soul bonded, the pair had made hundreds of supply runs to the Shresta main depot, but repetition did not dull the strain the ritodex (~10 days) long journey could be on any soul bonded mate's relationship. On this void journey, like any other, a cold death was as close as misjudgment or bad luck, tempers will flare in the shadow of fear but in space keeping a cool head was just as vital to survival as navigation and life support.

Getta powered down the thrusters and their shuttle settled into its final path to intercept the giant orbital supply station _Shresta Primatt_ which gleamed in the sunset of _Shresta_, the planet for which it took its name. _Shresta_ itself was a large, hot ball of gas with more than a hundred moons in the _Bara'tex_ star system. When the ancestors of Getta and Regma first floated to this world they knew it to be a special place, with moons that were bountiful in metals and ices of all varieties and a powerful magnetic field....everything a _chen gara_ (void borne) needed to thrive and build.

In addition to plentiful resources, the hot gas giant burns with radiation, Regma could feel it blessing her _chen gara_ bones like a low, cold tingle. Like other void borne species the _chen gara_ had adapted to the powerful cosmic fields which permeate the endless vacuum, what would cause sickness in a planet bound species, the void borne find energy for life.

"We should be close enough to get the supply net signal..." Getta said, without responding Regma powered up the radio antennas and receivers, and downloaded the latest manifests from the logi guilds on the station... "They have everything we need it looks like" Regma said....although there did not seem to be any fresh _lemote_ fruit like she had hoped... "not much fresh fruit though"

As had become their habit, once the radio was fully powered Getta sent a transmission to the station landing towers "...Shresta tower this is shuttle _Setak'tai_ on apoapsis intercept, requesting berthing in supply guild..." "We see you shuttle _Setak'tai_ at ten interum (1000 seconds) to mag lock, twelve interum to descent...cutting it close shuttle _Setak'tai_..." The tower responded and continued with instructions to hold course and prepare for docking and, to Regma's relief, no mention of Getta's high speed maneuver.

_Shresta Primatt_ is a massive, ancient construct of steel and stone finished white. It had been orbited by the ancestors of Getta and Regma nearly five tekadex (~5k years) ago. The original station had a circumference of ten tekudex with enough centrifugal habs to house a hundred thousand _chen gara_. Over time like many other bastions of the void borne, it had grown as needs and populations grew. Now _Shresta Primatt_ is home to millions of souls and its circumference had grown a hundred fold.

It was a amalgamation of spinning hab sectors, shipyards, foundries, and bustling trade hubs, all inhabited by _chen gara_ and hundreds of other races and species. As more sections were added, tall spires were also built, and those spires were eventually connected and on them were built more towers and platforms, on which were built workshops and subtrade sectors, and on top of those...even taller spires.

It is one of the best examples of a void borne "space mega city" and Regma felt a buzz of pride in her ancestors that built the _Shresta Primatt_. They had written the station's motto deep below the spires and foundries in the original section's hull, on a platinum plate etched in diamond and gold, _"In the sky of Shresta this station shines, until the frontier breaks"_.

When viewed from above in a higher orbit, it resembles a scalloped plate floating across the brown, red, and white clouds of _Shresta_, or a flower-shaped cookie floating in tea with cream. Viewed from below it appears as it is, a massive city floating in the stars with hundreds of towers reaching 20 or 30 tekudex (~30-45 miles) into space from the flat main station.

As the _Setak'tai_ approached from below and the station moved into the shadow of _Shresta_ its sunset bathed the bottom of the station in deep red. As Regma watched the artificial night overtake the brilliant red and the station lights lit up in its wake, she reached across the the cockpit and held Getta's hand. He grasped back and smiled...it was a rare and beautiful sight that they had only witnessed a handful of times. "I'll take that as good luck" Getta said, Regma was reminded of the old _chen gara_ saying _"There is much beauty and hardship in the void, it is not good to meet either alone"_.
