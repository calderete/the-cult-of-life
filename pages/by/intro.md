The _Cult of Life_ knows much and very little about _Gul Suma_, it does not know which world the being known as _Gul Suma_ resides. The cult savants do know it refers to light by its constituent wave-particles which it calls _timeless motes_, and anything made of real matter _weighted motes_.

When successfully queried if _Gul Suma_ considered itself a _bright will_? _Gul suma_ has responded yes, but one that is of the fringe length of persistence, and lack of physical constructs. As a follow up when asked if _Gul Suma_ would always be? The reply was "as long as _weighted motes_ move, and can be grasped, _Gul Suma_ will be and know all to the edge"
