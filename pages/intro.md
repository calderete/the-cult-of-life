## The cult of life

**In the distant future**

Life - Some galactic scholars say it should be counted as a rival to the fundamental forces of nature. Life is the most efficient progenitor of chaos and a stubborn force that bends mindless nature to its will. All celestial bodies, whether planetoids or diffuse dust and gas, will _blindly_  follow the geometry their fate until time itself freezes, unless life comes along. In a dead star system the largest source of energy is the star itself. A collection of matter and gravity so great, that the forces which make up reality, and can reach across only the smallest distances, make their true power known by bursting into starlight. When there is life however, great minds and societies may rise to harness those same forces. If those great minds do not succumb to the avarice that comes with mastery over nature, they can even outshine the starlight that had warmed the darkness which they floated and spun. Life itself pushing back against the black and even void, rivaling that which is infinite.

Most life in our universe will be forgotten, their civilization's histories are mostly the same....as macro and cosmic forces overrun their livable habitats and they are unable to bridge the vastness of space to find a refuge...they fade away into extinction. As such, life, or at least life which has risen to leave its mark, however fleeting on the cosmos - is rare.

**_blindly_** In this context 'blindly' means that has no information about the future, 'mutely' in that matter has no opinion of things.</br>
**_change_** In this way the cult of life is living example (pun intended) of why one could make argument for life role in the development of nature given the vast influence of the cult of life.
