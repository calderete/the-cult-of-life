War is a ravenous machine among the stars, fueled by the unjust, devouring life and cracking worlds. Master gunship commander Shotero Kax-Roel was a productive piece of the war machine.




----------------------
The Core race of the Ogions call themselves the Worgot and their origin world they called Gahshot, they were always a war-like race. Kashot Prime, as their origin world is now known, was a fiercely divided world, each continent divided into smaller regions. each jealously protecting their own sovereignty marked by imaginary lines. Those regions were often ruled by individuals who ruled only for the sake of being the ruler. They desired only power itself never realizing the great cosmic gift that has been bestowed upon them.

The salvation of the Worgot came in the form of a comet shower...as their twin star passed through the rouge icy remnants of some galactic cataclysm, comets...the universal harbingers of doom or good fortune, raced across the skys of Gahshot by the dozens. The scholars among Worgot..not without foresight, began to scan the skies in the hopes of an early warning of on oncoming comet...they failed. The first comet was an icy behemoth that was slung-shot around an inner planet and into the glare of the lesser star, when it was finally spotted and its course worked out, it was days(3.45 cycles) from impact. The shock wave killed billions in a single cycle. And in 20 cycles two thirds of the population would be dead.

 And the Worgot although devastated and living in comparative squalor compared to the great palaces of the old world, survived. Eventually they even thrived, and found their salvation, so long in the coming, eventually manifested itself when the first permanent stations began to orbit the world of Gahshot. A united world taking its first steps on a long journey to interstellar mastery.





Shotero's personal hud lit up with a text transmission. "FROM:<COM Flight Group> target ids confirmed proceed." The 2 frigates they were tracking from stealth turned from blue to red on all screens and Shotero began a squad wide text transmission, the coms interface autocompleting the words as fast as his thoughts could form them.... "TO:<GUN Striker 1> begin soft warm up. T - 45 until weapons warm up. T - 145 until weapons free<SENT>" A timer in the top corner of the HUD a counter blinks 145 and begins descending to zero, the timer subjectively synced with his squadron....130....Time to start the soft warm up, Targeting systems initializing, low-power ship control online...110....coolant systems online....100....weapons powering up....if the pirate miners had any scope or sensors pointing in his squads direction, they could detect them, but it didn't matter, in Shotero's opinion laying in wait in stealth mode had been an excess precaution anyways. Fleet command had sized and weighed the pirates, it would not be a long fight...maybe even a quick death for most of them. 50....the calm before the storm...the only systems left to turn on where not quite yet needed. T - 40 time to "TO:<GUN Striker 1> coms free begin full power up".
